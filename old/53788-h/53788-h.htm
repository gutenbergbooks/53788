<p class="h2">ELIZABETH, HER FOLKS</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">John&#39;s Girl</span></p>

<p class="indent">A little girl in a short-sleeved, blue ruffled
nightgown flung herself across the foot of
Grandmother Swift&#39;s great guest-chamber
bed, and sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class="indent">Downstairs, each in an old-fashioned, valanced
rocking chair before one of the living-room windows,
Grandfather and Grandmother Swift were discussing
the newcomer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think she seems real glad to be here,&quot; Grandmother
was saying. &quot;She looks a little pale and
peaked, but we&#39;ll soon have her fed up and as brown
as a berry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never see any brown berries. All the berries I
ever had anything to do with was red or blue, but
there must be berries that is brown, if you say so,
Mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother&#39;s amber needles flew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She seemed real pleased at the things I had
cooked up for her,&quot; she said, &quot;especially the chocolate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
cake. She didn&#39;t more than sample the lemon
pie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought she seemed a little high-toned about
her vittles. She kinder turned up her nose at your
ginger tea, Mother. She was used to having her
dinner at night, she said, and drunk nothing but a
demi-tassy after it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You hadn&#39;t ought to have begun your teasing
before she was fairly in the house, Father&mdash;it made
her feel strange. She hasn&#39;t been here for four years,
and four years, when a child is just getting into her
teens, is a long while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An inch in a man&#39;s nose is considerable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother surveyed him severely over the top
of her bi-focal glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speaking of noses,&quot; she said, &quot;you be careful
how you try pulling Elizabeth&#39;s nose or chuck her
under the chin, or any such actions. Growing girls
is particular about such things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I&#39;m particular who I chuck under the
chin. I&#39;m afraid you are going to ruin your eyes
with those glasses, Mother, you have to strain so
hard to look over the top when you want to see
anything at a distance, and work so hard trying
to look under &#39;em when you want to see anything
nigh to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He chuckled at Grandmother&#39;s sudden effort to
concentrate her keen brown eyes within the space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
of the glass half-moon through which she was supposed
to focus her knitting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just wanted to bind off the sleeve before the
light faded,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When Congress repeals this here light-saving
scheme, it&#39;ll hurt your feelings two ways, won&#39;t it,
Mother? You won&#39;t have the satisfaction of expressing
your mind at the Administration for setting
the clock back, and you won&#39;t have a extry hour of
light to strain your eyes in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old lady&mdash;she was seventy-five, but in a strong
light when she was not quite becomingly dressed,
which was not often, she looked sixty&mdash;drew her
rocking chair closer to the small window, and knitted
in silence. All the windows in that remarkable old
house were small, and divided into little, square panes.
Grandfather drew <i>his</i> rocking chair closer to <i>his</i>
window, and made a great pretence of reading, but
he did not turn or rattle his paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You trying to prove that your eyes is just as
good as mine? Well, I don&#39;t know as I blame you,
Father, but your glasses is out in the barn on the
feed box. If you could read a line without &#39;em, I&#39;d
know the contents of the whole paper by this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather Swift grinned, and unbuttoned a
lower button on the immaculate linen waistcoat he
had put on in his granddaughter&#39;s honour&mdash;he wore
no coat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
&quot;Got back at me that time, didn&#39;t you, Mother?
I always feel uneasy after I get the better of you till
you&#39;ve worked the laugh round to me again. Well,
I thought we&#39;d be setting up till all hours of the
night, entertaining John&#39;s girl, and hearing all the
news of the family. I wonder if she always goes to
bed before sundown. She didn&#39;t look a might
sleepy to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She travelled all the way from New York&mdash;of
course she was sleepy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her father brought her all the way from New
York to Boston, and she rested there a couple of
days before he put her on the Cape train. All she
had to do was to sit among her bags and boxes till
she got here. Three shiny black bags, she had, and
as proud of &#39;em as if she had made &#39;em herself&mdash;and
a wardrobe trunk. I thought myself that all trunks
was wardrobe trunks until she told me different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t hardly judge the child till she gets
settled down a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather Swift let his paper fall to the floor.
Then he picked it up and folded it carefully, and
made a place for it on the stand between the two
windows under the wide fronds of Grandmother&#39;s
pet fern, which was supposed never to be displaced
for such a purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did hope John&#39;s girl was going to be a little more
like folks,&quot; he admitted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
The dimity curtains in the guest chamber puffed
in the light night breeze. An insect with the voice
of a bird set up a cheerful chirping just under her
window, but Elizabeth Swift, in a little, huddled
heap on the four-poster bed that had belonged to
her great-grandmother, with her head smothered
in the best goose-feather pillows to shut out the
sound she was making, was still sobbing as if she
could never stop again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They don&#39;t even speak the English language,&quot;
she was saying to herself. &quot;They are just countrified
and ordinary, and I&#39;ve got to have them for my
grandparents just as if they were like other people,
and eat great hunks of corn beef and drink ginger
tea, and never see my parents, or my dear, dear
brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The goose-feather pillow got wetter and wetter
until Elizabeth, still very miserable but quieter now,
began to be concerned about the damage she was
doing, and finally dragged herself up on the edge
of the bed to examine it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mustn&#39;t do damage to property, no matter
how anguished I am,&quot; she thought. &quot;People&#39;s things
aren&#39;t to blame, if they do say &#39;hadn&#39;t oughter,&#39; and
&#39;ain&#39;t,&#39; but I don&#39;t see how my own mother and my
own Father John could have sent me here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She groped for the second pillow, and the tears
started afresh, but presently she began to try to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
stop them. The soft wind that was pushing the
dimity curtains into the room brought with it a
heavy breath of honeysuckle and roses. Her mind
began to stray away from her immediate trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honeysuckle toilet water might be the very best
toilet water that any one could have. I wonder if
you couldn&#39;t make some with honeysuckle blossoms
and wood alcohol. There&#39;s a bird going to bed in
that tree. Maybe it&#39;s an oriole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had never seen an oriole except in pictures,
but that was one of the things she had wanted to
come to Cape Cod for, when she had thought she
was coming with her mother and her big soldier
brother to a cottage on the beach, before they had
realized how sick he was going to be when he got
home from France. The bird chirped drowsily once
more, and the insect in the grass drew its string over
its bow again. She almost went to the window to
look, but she had cried so long that she wasn&#39;t quite
willing to think of pleasant things yet. Her head
ached and her nose was sore, and the second pillow
was almost as wet as the first. She hung them both
over the foot-board to dry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose it is a little funny to cry quarts into
old family goose-feather pillows. I might have cried
so long I would have had to use a whole feather-bed,
too. I wonder if Grandmother would scold me just
as if I were a child. I told her I was going to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
my fourteenth birthday here. I told my horrid
grandfather, when he pinched me, that I wasn&#39;t
in the habit of being teased. What would Jean
Forsyth say if she could see me now? I guess I&#39;ll
get up and put some talcum powder on my nose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a knock on the door as she began to
move around the room. She scrambled back into
bed meaning to pretend to be asleep, but her grandmother
opened the door and came in just as if she
had spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you asleep, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Grandma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you might like a glass o&#39; milk to kinder
stay your stomach between now and breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Grandma.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you like a cookie to go with it? I made
up a whole jar full o&#39; sugar-molasses cookies so&#39;s
you could go and help yourself to them whenever
you was a mind to. I&#39;ll set the milk right here on
the stand, and then I&#39;ll go fetch the cookie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you for the milk, Grandmother, but I don&#39;t
care for the cookie. I never eat between meals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandfather and I had a little spell o&#39; argument
about that cookie. He claimed you wouldn&#39;t
be used to eating sugar-molasses cookies, but I
thought you might of inherited your father&#39;s taste
for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have inherited a great many of Father&#39;s tastes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
&quot;Your brother Johnny, he used to like &#39;em, too, when
he was a little feller. He was a real good little boy,
Johnny was. He spent every summer of his life with
me and Grandpa till he began to go to that college.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We don&#39;t called him Johnny. We called him
Junior when he was growing up, and I called him
Buddy, but now we call him John&mdash;or John Junior
when we wish to distinguish him from Father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, your grandfather and I always called him
Johnny. It seemed to suit him. I hope he&#39;ll get well
enough to get down to Gran&#39;ma&#39;s before the summer
is over. Gran&#39;ma could help him to get well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is quite sick now, and unable to see any one
at all. He is very devoted to me, but he is in such
a weakened condition that even I wasn&#39;t allowed to
see him. He won the D. S. C.&mdash;the Distinguished
Service Cross, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know so much about this new-fangled
soldiering. I lost two brothers in the Civil War&mdash;your
great uncles they would have been. Only eighteen
and twenty, but grown men they seemed to be
in them days. Your father favoured my brother
William more&#39;n he did anybody on his father&#39;s side
o&#39; the house. Johnny, he looked like Sam when he
was a little feller. Well, I&#39;m real glad Johnny got
home safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, we can&#39;t be sure that he is safe yet,
but the recent reports have been very encouraging.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
&quot;Your father&#39;s proud of his boy, I guess. It was
a great thing for him to have a grown boy to go.
The next best thing to going himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think he cared about going himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he ever say anything about not caring to
go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever heard him express himself on
the subject; but the work he was doing here, of course,
was very important. Anybody who was connected
with steel production in any way felt that they were
being a great deal more useful on this side of the
ocean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever your father was doing on this side of
the ocean, I guess his soul and his spirit was all the
way across it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are mistaken, Grandmother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Swift looked at her granddaughter
over the rim of her bi-focal glasses, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s one o&#39; the easiest things in this world to be
mistaken, Elizabeth,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth put out her hand for her glass of milk,
and began to drink it with a sudden meekness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You go and set yourself in the chair by the bed,
and finish your milk, and I&#39;ll lay back your bed for
you. There&#39;s a golden robin has a nest in that tree,
and I guess there&#39;ll be a family there pretty soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean an oriole, don&#39;t you, Grandmother?
Oh, I&#39;m crazy to see one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;Some folks calls it that. Golden robin means
more to me. I like to have things called by their prettiest
names.&quot; She was busying herself about the bed.
&quot;I&#39;m going to turn these pillows over on their dry
side,&quot; she said, as if Great-grandmother&#39;s goose-feather
pillows had always one tear-dampened surface.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But her grandmother wasn&#39;t looking at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speaking o&#39; names,&quot; she was saying, &quot;I&#39;ll tell
you a conundrum that my grandmother used to
tell me, a real appropriate conundrum, seeing that
it&#39;s about a namesake o&#39; yours. See how long it
takes you to guess it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how could they?&quot; Elizabeth cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they did, and now&#39;s a good chance to show
how smart you are, so&#39;s Gran&#39;ma needn&#39;t make any
mistake about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something in the eyes over the bi-focal glasses
made Elizabeth squirm a trifle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The girls at home,&quot; she said, rapidly, &quot;often call
me Betsy. Oh, I know now. That&#39;s the answer.
It was all one girl&mdash;Elizabeth, Elspeth, Betsy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
Bess&mdash;all nicknames for Elizabeth. I never heard
of any one called Elspeth, but I&#39;m called all the others
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your great-grandmother was always called Elspeth.
She always called you that when you was a
baby.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she? I didn&#39;t know that I ever saw Great-grandmother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She saw you. She loved you better than any
grandchild she lived to see, because you was named
after her, I suppose. She used to say that conundrum
was wrote about her, because she was four or five
different characters all in one. Elizabeth when she
was feeling high and mighty, Elspeth when she was
good, Betsy when she had trouble keeping herself in,
and Bess when she put on her airs and graces. Bessie
was a real stylish name in her day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I have different names for myself&mdash;Beth
you know, and Betty, they are contractions of Elizabeth,
too, but I never knew any one else who thought
of themselves in different characters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your great-grandmother was quite a remarkable
woman. She was your grandfather&#39;s mother, but
she seemed like my own. You look considerable
like her, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve always thought I resembled my own mother
more than any one. She was an Endicott, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your great-grandmother was a Jones. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Joneses had the name o&#39; being one of the likeliest
families in Crocker Neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And she had the reputation of having the prettiest
manners and the kindest ways of any girl from
here to Chatham. Your father takes after her in
that. It was the first trouble that ever come to
him when his gran&#39;ma died, and he took it hard.
He went out behind the henhouse and lay there a
whole night; just the way he used to when he had
trouble as a boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he was a grown man then, and I was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wasn&#39;t so much of a grown man that he didn&#39;t
lay and blubber all night. He ain&#39;t so much of a
grown man now that he wouldn&#39;t do the same thing
if he was in the same kind of trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;he didn&#39;t when we thought we had lost
Buddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother&#39;s eyes looked kindly over the tops
of her ridiculous glasses, but all that she said was,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come and hop into bed now. You&#39;ll get cold
setting by that open window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I know how my own father felt and acted
last winter,&quot; Elizabeth said, but not aloud, as she
slipped between the creamy linen sheets, and her
grandmother tucked her under the blue-and-white
comfortable. She closed her eyes for the good-night
kiss that she expected to submit to, but it did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
come. Instead, her grandmother made her way to
the door and stood holding it open, as she looked back
to say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandfather and I are real glad to have you
with us, Elizabeth. It&#39;s always a day of rejoicing
to us when we have our own flesh and blood under
our roof. No matter what you start out in life thinking,
the conclusion you kinder come to, when all&#39;s
said and done, is that blood is thicker than water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her tone was exactly as gentle as before, but alone
in the darkening room Elizabeth felt a slow wave of
crimson mount to her forehead, and spread hot over
her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandmother doesn&#39;t think I am very nice,&quot; she
said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">The Steppe Children</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Buddy:&quot; Elizabeth was writing, &quot;dear,
dear, dear, <i>dear</i> Buddy: Mother says I may
write you real letters, now, all about everything,
because you are in a condition to bear it. So
I am starting in bright and early this morning to go
into details about my existence here, and my rejoicings
at your convalesence. (I spelled that right, I
know. I am naturally a good speller, but I have such
a poor example set by my brother the Harvard
gradjuate, that I fall into bad ways at the slightest
provocation.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First let me testify that I love you best&mdash;best&mdash;best
in the world next to and including Father John
and Mother Darby. You know that already, but
if you are like me, the things you like to be told best
are the things you know already. You know also
already how I feel about your being sick. Please
get better and come down here quick. I want you
here, oh! so very, very much. Father and Mother
thought I had better get the benifit of country air,
but they don&#39;t know that I can&#39;t get much benifit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
from country air while you are breathing cloriform
and bandige lint all the time. I am not as comfortable
in my mind as I should be in stuffy New York,
in the hotel with Mother and Father. I know you
will suspect my motives in yearning for hotel life,
but it is really you and Mother and Father I want
more even than life at the Holland House. Of
course, I can&#39;t help feeling that if the house in Jersey
is going to be closed and the family moved into town,
though even in the dead of summer, that I ought to
be moved with it, instead of being shoved off down
here.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy, I know you used to like it here, but I am
miserable. I know you would think it was awful
of me if you knew how I felt inside all the time, but
I am not half-civilized or savage enough to like the
primative way things are down here. I think girls
are more sensitive and refined than boys and care
what they eat more, and how things sound that are
said to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that sounds horrid. Grandmother
thinks I am horrid, though she is very tactful, I
will say;&mdash;but Grandfather teases me from morning
till night, and has no respect for my years. I
don&#39;t see why he thinks I am such a child. He was
engaged to Grandmother when she was sixteen, and
that is only two years and forty-one days older than
I am. But oh! Buddy, I wish my other grandparents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
had lived. I think I am all Endicott, really,
because I feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Children and little girls keep coming to call on me.
The girls of my own age that I used to play with keep
their distance, and I am not sorry. It&#39;s hard enough
to be polite as it is. Life is one eternal round of corn
beef and cabbage and fried fish hash. I hope you
get plenty of steaks and chops and delicacies. Grandmother
won&#39;t let me go in bathing unless I have someone
to go with, and I haven&#39;t any one to go with.
The motors whizz by all day, but Grandfather&#39;s
Ford is in the repair shop, and so I don&#39;t get anywhere.
Tennis? All the boys own the courts
around here, and won&#39;t let the girls on them for fear
they will mess them up for the tournaments. I
don&#39;t know any girls to play with, so that doesn&#39;t
affect me, but you can see what a good time I am
having.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, &#39;a sorrow&#39;s crown of sorrow is remembering
happier things.&#39; We used to have good times together,
Buddy, befo&#39; de war.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Your affectionate, but very blighted sister,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&quot;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth&mdash;Eliza&mdash;Elspeth&mdash;Bess&mdash;Bessie&mdash;Lizzie&mdash;Betsy&mdash;Beth, etc.</span>&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As she folded the closely written sheets of lilac-tinted
notepaper and crowded them into their envelope,
her grandmother&#39;s voice summoned her to
the head of the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;The step-children are here,&quot; was what she
seemed to be saying; &quot;shall I send them up or are
you ready to come down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, Grandmother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The step-children are here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you wish, Grandmother. It sounds just as
if you said the step-children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did say the step-children. I&#39;m going to send them
up for you to amuse them. Go right on upstairs,
children. She ain&#39;t a bear. She won&#39;t bite you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;&quot; pant&mdash;pant&mdash;&quot;see a bear yesterday, a dancing
bear. Didn&#39;t I see a bear, Mose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, babe,&quot; another breathy voice answered.
&quot;You don&#39;t want to talk so much when you go
a-visiting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A mysterious single file of chubby children, considerably
more ragged than dirty, made a cautious
way up the steep stairs, panting as they came.
Elizabeth led the way into the big chamber where
she had been writing, and the three followed her
solemnly. Her first instinct was to give them each
a friendly pat, as if they were so many little dogs
who had been running hard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, children,&quot; she said. She was
fond of children, and these were adorable specimens,
despite their superfluous fringes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, teacher,&quot; they answered, with
unexpected promptitude.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not exactly a teacher, you know. I&#39;m
just Miss&mdash;I mean&mdash;Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We know who you be,&quot; the eldest, a boy, volunteered.
&quot;You&#39;m Miss Laury Ann&#39;s granddaughty,
that&#39;s who you be. We come to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was very kind of you,&quot; Elizabeth smiled,
&quot;but I don&#39;t know who you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;m the step-children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are just about like steps,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;but
that seems a funny name to call you just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis our <i>name</i>,&quot; the second child, a girl with long
red curls, met Elizabeth&#39;s eyes and subsided instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;S-T-E-P-P-E,&quot; the boy spelled out. &quot;&#39;Tain&#39;t
a joke. It&#39;s our name. It&#39;s Parper&#39;s name and
Marmer&#39;s name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steppe-father and Steppe-mother,&quot; Elizabeth
said to herself, &quot;and the Steppe children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have other names?&quot; she said aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m Moses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m Mabel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m Madget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her real name is Margery, but she calls herself
Madget, and so we call her that. Madget means a
dwarft, and she&#39;s little for her age. I&#39;m nine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m four,&quot; said Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">All this had so much the effect of a recitation that
Elizabeth asked them if they spoke pieces.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
&quot;I speak &#39;Shavings,&#39;&quot; Moses said. &quot;I&mdash;I mean
Excelsior.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speak &#39;Baby&#39;s Evening Prayer.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speak, &#39;Little drops o&#39; water&mdash;little grains o&#39;
sand&mdash;make a mighty ocean&mdash;an&#39; a pleasant land,&#39;&quot;
Madget contributed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She didn&#39;t ask you to speak it,&quot; Moses said,
witheringly, &quot;she only asked did you speak it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you went and spoke it,&quot; Mabel added,
accusingly.</p>

<p class="indent">The wail that Madget set up at being accused of
this breach of polite usage sent Elizabeth&#39;s arms
straight around her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must remember she&#39;s only a baby,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what we tell her,&quot; Mabel said, &quot;but we
can&#39;t make her pay no attention to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must pay attention to it, and take care of
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! we take care of her, all right,&quot; Moses agreed,
darkly. &quot;We gotter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t your mother take care of her sometimes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, ma&#39;am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she sick&mdash;or something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. She&#39;s sick o&#39; living, she says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she do all the time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she have to stay in bed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, when she ain&#39;t up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does the doctor say is the matter with her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She don&#39;t have no doctor. She reads novels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who does the cooking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We don&#39;t have no cooking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you eat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bread and molasses, and doughnuts out the
cart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you ever have any meat or chicken or fish
hash or anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When my a&#39;nt comes we do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then your mother isn&#39;t really sick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She feels as if she was, and she says that&#39;s just as
bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to be a hired girl when I grow up, and
go out to work where I can make pies and cakes,&quot;
Mabel said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to be a cook on a vessel,&quot; Moses said,
&quot;and get learned how to make vittles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to be a bake-cart,&quot; Madget said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to her. Don&#39;t you know you can&#39;t be a
bakery cart?&quot; Moses jeered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You gotter be the one that drives it,&quot; Mabel
contributed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanter <i>be</i> a bake-cart and curry the food
around all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;All right, you may.&quot; Elizabeth spoke just in
time to avert another tearful crisis. &quot;What would
you like to do to amuse yourselves, children? Would
you like to have me tell you a story?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; Moses said, promptly. He indicated
the row of shiny travelling bags by the
mahogany what-not. Elizabeth had long since unpacked
them, but they were such proud possessions
that she could not bear to put them out of sight.
&quot;I want to see what&#39;s in <i>that</i>,&quot; he said, selecting
the hat-box.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to see what&#39;s in that,&quot; Mabel said, choosing
the suitcase in her turn.</p>

<p class="indent">Madget fell upon the overnight bag.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanner see that,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s laugh rang out gayly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are acting just like the story of the three
bears,&quot; she said. &quot;There isn&#39;t anything inside of
the bags now, but I&#39;ll show them to you, just the
same. This is my hat-box, see, and these silver
letters on the outside are my initials, E. S.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is, too, something inside,&quot; Mabel cried,
as the brightly flowered lining was disclosed. &quot;Trimming.
Now open mine. There&#39;s trimming in all
of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a pocket, too,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now me,&quot; said Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t any trimming in this,&quot; Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
said, hastily, &quot;but there are lots of pockets, and see,
in this pocket there is a little cake of lovely smelling
soap, and I&#39;m going to give it to you. You can wash
your face and hands with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She ain&#39;t a very good one to give soap to,&quot; Moses
said. &quot;Water makes her nervous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll give you all a piece of soap if you&#39;ll promise
to use it every day&mdash;the big bear and the middle-sized
bear, and the baby bear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t going to be no bear,&quot; Moses said, &quot;I was a
bear in a canatartar. Zibe Hunt&mdash;he had me on a
string, and he sang a song.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of a song?&quot;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I am an animal trainer,</span>
<span class="i2">This is my polar bear.</span>
<span class="i0">He comes from the far-distant mountains,</span>
<span class="i2">Out of his icy lair.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mabel obliged, &quot;And then he done some tricks,&quot; she
added, &quot;and Zibe hit him; and Parper licked him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should your father lick him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what he done to Zibe after the canatartar.
He don&#39;t like to play bears now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see a dancing bear,&quot; Madget said. &quot;Didn&#39;t I,
Mose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You better stop talking about bears,&quot; Moses
hinted, darkly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;If you&#39;ll bring the children downstairs, Elizabeth,&quot;
Grandmother called from the foot of the staircase,
&quot;they can have some milk and cookies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget made directly for the staircase, and as
promptly fell all the way into Grandmother&#39;s arms,
from which position she scowled and freed herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She always falls downstairs,&quot; Mabel said, tolerantly.
&quot;It don&#39;t hurt her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does her good,&quot; Moses explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Milk,&quot; said Madget, &quot;and cookies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The little thing is really hungry,&quot; Grandmother
said. &quot;How long ago did she have her breakfast,
Mose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We don&#39;t have no breakfast to our house. She
wouldn&#39;t eat her bread because she said she was
skeered of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Scared of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, some of it had gray fur on it, and she was
afraid it was going to crawl out on her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandmother,&quot; Elizabeth cried, &quot;why are these
children neglected like this? Are they so poor or
what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They ain&#39;t no poorer than a great many other
folks. Their mother won&#39;t do anything for them&mdash;that&#39;s
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She don&#39;t like work. Mercy me! They&#39;ve
et a dozen cookies already. You fill up their glasses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Elizabeth. I stirred half a cup o&#39; cream into the
pitcher so&#39;s to be sure they was nourished.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why isn&#39;t something done about them? The
Charity Organization Society, or somebody, ought
to take up the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The only organization society we got is the fire
department. These children don&#39;t need putting
out, they need taking in more, I should say. If one
person in the world lays down and refuses to do what
the Lord requires of him he puts a powerful lot o&#39;
machinery out o&#39; gear. Mis&#39; Steppe&mdash;she just refuses
to do her part in the Lord&#39;s scheme.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she old and ugly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s young and pretty if she&#39;d fix herself up
some. She come from real good folks, too, but when
she see how hard it was to live and take care o&#39; her
children like other folks, she just decided to lay down,
and down she lay. Most all of us feels inclined to
shirk our responsibilities at one time or another, but
most of us thinks better of it after a spell. She
thought worse of it, Mis&#39; Steppe did. Too bad you
don&#39;t like sugar-molasses cookies, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; Elizabeth blushed. &quot;I was only just
waiting for the children to get all they wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll never do that, but they got all they can
hold. You open the screen door, Elizabeth&mdash;&mdash;Scat,
out you go,&quot; she said, shooing at the Steppe
family as if they were so many chickens, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
children scattered instantly, chickenwise, onto the
lawn, and down the path to the gate. &quot;Too much
of anything is good for nothing,&quot; she concluded,
tranquilly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy, my darling, I have broken into my letter
again to say that I am a pig&mdash;the piggiest kind of pig,
and this letter to you is a piggy letter. I will send
it because I wrote it, and because I haven&#39;t got any
time to write another, better one. I only wish to
add that in certain ways I am as bad as &#39;Mis&#39;
Steppe,&#39; that&#39;s a good pun you see, whether you
know who I&#39;m talking about or not. I&#39;m going to
be a better sister to you, and a better daughter to
Father John and Mother Darby. I&#39;ve found out
that one poor mother can do so much damage in
the world that I don&#39;t want to be a poor&mdash;anything.
Get well, and write me a letter, Buddy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sister

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">The Little Room&mdash;and Peggy</span></p>

<p class="indent">The golden robins woke first, and demanded
their breakfast in weak, insistent voices.
Then the blue counterpane slid to the floor
and two ruffled blue dimity sleeves were flung out at
right angles. The clear bell of the schoolhouse
clock struck six times.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, I must hustle,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">She flew to the wash-stand and poured the creamy,
gilt-edged bowl of the best room set full of well water,
in which she laved and splashed. An aroma of bacon
and coffee and the inimitable savour of raised biscuits
helped to accelerate her progress. She sang
as she dressed, but she thought of nothing at all but
her breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">Her grandfather, in his shirt sleeves and sand-coloured
waistcoat, was already at the table when she
took her place there, and unfolded her red-fringed,
damask napkin from the napkin ring that was her
father&#39;s, and marked with his name. It was on a
standard, and supported by twin boys, wreathed and
carrying trumpets. Elizabeth always tried to hide
it behind some dish as she ate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
&quot;Good morning, Miss Betsy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, Grandfather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hired girl, who was sixteen and the daughter of
a neighbour, wiped her immaculate pink hands on a
more immaculate and pinker apron, and took her
seat opposite Elizabeth. She was an enormously
fat blonde, who never spoke without blushing.
Grandmother was bustling about with plates of biscuit
and coffee cups.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The reason we don&#39;t have more help around the
place is that Mother wears herself all out waitin&#39; on
them,&quot; Grandfather observed. &quot;Judidy, ain&#39;t you
got no control over Mis&#39; Swift? Can&#39;t you make her
set down to the table when breakfast is ready?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir,&quot; Judidy blushed. &quot;She told me to set
down, so I set.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, whenever she tells me to set down&mdash;I set,
but I thought maybe you had more independence
of spirit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth, here&mdash;she don&#39;t pay much attention
to what anybody says. She sets all the time, so&#39;s
to be on the safe side. Well, I guess we&#39;re in for a
spell o&#39; bad weather. I see old Samuel Swift out
bright and early this morning, and when Samuel
comes out of his hiding that means rain sure enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth shuddered. Samuel Swift was an unbelievably
unkempt individual who lived in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
hermit&#39;s shack in the woods, and was locally known
as a &quot;weather breeder.&quot; Whenever he harnessed
his ancient mare to his antiquated buggy and
emerged into the light of day the wind changed,
according to neighbourhood tradition, and the fog
and rain swept in. She quoted:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;There was an old man with a beard,</span>
<span class="i0">Who said, &#39;it is just as I feared,</span>
<span class="i2">Three rats and a hen,</span>
<span class="i2">An owl and a wren</span>
<span class="i0">Have all made their nests in my beard!&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s poetry,&quot; her grandfather explained with
a wink at Judidy. &quot;Fall to,&quot; he said as he served
the last plateful of golden eggs and crisp bacon.
&quot;Here&#39;s Mother with her last chore done, and
we ain&#39;t more than half through our breakfast.
If that coffee&#39;s for Elizabeth, Mother, you can give
it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought Elizabeth could have a little&mdash;very
weak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at my table,&quot; Grandfather said.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth poured a glass of milk and drank it in
silence, but her grandfather gave her one sharp look
from under his bushy brows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see old Samuel&#39;s crawled out,&quot; he said, turning
to Grandmother. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have some wet
weather, now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a disgusting creature,&quot; Elizabeth said, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
resentfully at the jug of milk&mdash;and taking a
second glass of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a kind of relation of yours. His mother
was my father&#39;s cousin. I think he&#39;d be better off
at the poor farm, but he&#39;s so dirty, the selectmen
kinder hate the job o&#39; trying to get him there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A relation?&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t know much about your Cape Cod relations,
do you, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I&#39;m a kind o&#39; relation, too,&quot; Judidy
simpered. &quot;Everybody&#39;s relation on Cape Cod, I
guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth would be proud to have you for a
relation, Judidy,&quot; Grandfather said, gravely. This
time Elizabeth saw the sharp glance that appraised
her, and she turned quickly toward Judidy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anybody would be proud to have a&mdash;a cousin
with such a lovely complexion,&quot; something urged her
to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Judidy protested. &quot;I&#39;m all tanned up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a friend in New York, Jean Forsyth,&quot;
Elizabeth said, presently, &quot;whose sister married a
count.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And when you get back to New York, you can
tell her all about your cousin Samuel,&quot; her grandfather
twinkled. &quot;My, what good times you can have,
comparing notes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father!&quot; said Grandmother Swift, warningly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;You run along upstairs, Elizabeth, and I&#39;ll come up
there as soon&#39;s I take one more swaller o&#39; coffee. I
got something I want to say when there ain&#39;t no men-folks
about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Upstairs again, Elizabeth took the photograph
of a deep-eyed girl in a silver frame out of the drawer
in her wardrobe trunk and gazed at it with gathering
woe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear, Jeanie,&quot; she said, &quot;the only thing
that would make me any less miserable in these
surroundings would be to sit down and write
you just exactly how things are, and that I can
never do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come with me,&quot; her grandmother called
suddenly from the threshold. &quot;I got an idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She led the way past the landing and tiny hall into
which the steep stairway debouched, into the regions
in the rear of the three bedrooms that Elizabeth was
familiar with. There seemed to be a chain of small,
stuffy rooms dimly stored with old furniture and
boxes, and not all on the same level, and beyond
them a low room, with a slanting roof, half chamber,
half hallway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never knew you had all these rooms,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;Why, the old house is enormous,
isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The front o&#39; the house is new; it hasn&#39;t been
built more&#39;n fifty years at the outset, but these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
back chambers belong to the old house&mdash;the one
your great-grandfather built to go to housekeeping
in.&quot; She flung open a door that led into a little room
still beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what a darling, what a sweetheart of a room!&quot;
Elizabeth cried. &quot;Whose was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was your Aunt Helen&#39;s room. She had it
papered in this robin&#39;s egg blue paper, and she got
a lot o&#39; old, painted furniture, and fixed it up real
cunning. I thought maybe you might like to do
the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was only one portion of the room in which
Elizabeth could stand upright. The roof sloped
gradually until it met the partition about shoulder
high, where two tiny, square windows, of many
panes, were set; but the main part of the chamber,
in spite of its low ceiling, was big enough to hold all
the essentials of comfortable furnishing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You could hunt around through the house and
the attic chamber until you found the things you
wanted to put in it, and furnish it just according to
your taste, and nobody would ever set foot inside of
it unless you happened to want them to. I know
girls. That&#39;s what they want.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you do know girls, Grandma,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;I guess Aunt Helen must have had a good
time growing up if you let her do things like this.
I don&#39;t remember her much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;Well, that ain&#39;t so remarkable. She&#39;s lived in
China since before you was born. I ain&#39;t never let
anybody use this room, but now I kinder think her
lease has expired. She&#39;s got daughters as big as
you, and sons that&#39;s grown men now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be just as good to her room!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you can&#39;t help it. There&#39;s a good spirit
in it. You rummage around in these different rooms
here, and then you go up in the barn chamber and
look till you find the things that suits you. There&#39;s
a powerful lot of what some folks calls antiques
around this place. Dealers and what-not is always
coming around and begging to look through my
pantry and my attic, wanting to buy all Grandmother&#39;s
pretty dishes, and a good many that warn&#39;t
so pretty, but I tell &#39;em all that when I&#39;m ready to
part with &#39;em I&#39;ll let &#39;em know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Washington Vase china that you use all the
time is really valuable, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, so those collectors say. It&#39;s valuable to
me, because I was brought up on it. Money value
ain&#39;t everything. The value of a dollar is one thing&mdash;the
joy it brings to you is another. You just rummage
around and find the things that you like,
and we&#39;ll get Grampa or Zeckal to move &#39;em up
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you ever think of such a thing, Grandmother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
&quot;Well, your grandpa thought he hadn&#39;t seen you
looking around the house much, and s&#39;long&#39;s it&#39;s
full o&#39; the kind o&#39; things that most city folks goes so
wild about, I kinder figured you might like something
to get your interest started. Helen, she was never
very much interested in anything she didn&#39;t have to
do with. You favour her in some ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I haven&#39;t seemed very much interested
in the house and things, I&#39;ve&mdash;had other things on
my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve been worried about your brother, and a
little homesick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t think I showed it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t always have to show your feelings to
Grandma. You better start in the barn chamber,
and then work on through the house. When you
get all the furniture you want, you can come to me
and get the key to that closet some day.&quot; She indicated
a door that might have been a panel set in
the wall, except for the keyhole, where a knob might
have been. &quot;There&#39;s a closet there, that runs clear
under the eaves. I guess you might find some fol-de-rols
you would like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might be fun to start in the closet,&quot; Elizabeth
suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might,&quot; her grandmother agreed, &quot;but better
save that till the last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
The barn chamber, reached by a rickety stairway
leading from the region of the stalls, from which a
white mare poked a friendly nose as she went by,
proved to be a storehouse of the most heterogeneous
assemblage of objects Elizabeth had ever imagined.
The overflow of fifty years of housecleaning and readjustment
had been brought together under those
dusty rafters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor things,&quot; Elizabeth thought, looking about
at the old settees and rocking chairs, broken backed
and legless. &quot;A horse in that condition is put out
of its misery. I don&#39;t suppose they could blindfold
and shoot an old sofa, but they might cremate it,
or something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She came upon the wreck of a little old rocking
chair, a child&#39;s chair, with a back beautifully decorated
with grape clusters and leaves, and two limp,
broken arms stuck out helplessly. These she tied
up with strips of faded blue cambric that were
lying about, and set the little chair gallantly rocking.</p>

<p class="indent">There were innumerable cracked china jugs, big
bowls, and strange wooden utensils and cabinets;
beds that had been taken apart, forlorn, carved old
posters minus springs or mattresses that were merely
being used as pens to keep forlorn chairs and tables
herded together. These things were all draped
with dust and spiders&#39; webs; and in a corner, from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
pile of ancient straw, Elizabeth heard a faint, continuous
rustling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mice!&quot; she said, &quot;but they can&#39;t frighten me
unless they get a good deal nearer. Still, I guess
I&#39;ll look carefully around and choose my nearest exit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her first discovery for her house furnishing was a
flag-bottomed chair with rockers about two inches
long. It was perfectly preserved. It wasn&#39;t a
child&#39;s chair, though it was very little of its age, she
told herself. The next was a spinning wheel, which
was the first one she had ever seen outside of a picture
book.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to get Grandmother to teach me to
spin on it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a writing desk, a rosewood box with inlaid
corner pieces, and a short-legged, square stand
to set it on; and then more rustling in the straw sent
Elizabeth suddenly downstairs again, though not
until she had segregated her chosen furniture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Zeckal, whoever he may be, can come and get
it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">She went back to the little blue room under the
eaves, and began a diagram of arrangement. Standing
against the wall was a long, panelled picture in
a black frame, that had made its appearance there
in her absence. Elizabeth lifted it to the light and
disclosed three barefooted ladies in flowing garments
of gauze, who were standing on a light turf from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
which lilies of the valley were springing. One
of these ladies was reclining on the breast of another,
and the third was standing erect and aloof, with
shining eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The Christian Graces,&#39;&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;For
goodness&#39; sake!&quot; and beneath, the curious inscription,
simulating letters cut into stone, was engraved
in a neat, Spencerian hand, &quot;Faith, Hope, and
Charity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For goodness&#39; sake!&quot; said Elizabeth, again.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned the picture around, and found on the
board at its back another inscription, written in a
round, childish hand, &quot;Helen Swift, aged eleven,
hung in my room to help me to remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I&#39;ll hang it in my room, to help me to
remember,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a little self-conscious about going down
to dinner. She knew that her grandfather had found
a good many things to chuckle at in her breakfast-table
conversation. She always knew afterward
just what things she had said that Grandfather would
consider most typical of what he referred to as her
&quot;city manner.&quot; This time she realized that her
allusion to Jean Forsyth&#39;s brother-in-law would
be the subject of many sly, humorous thrusts for a
long time to come. However, when she reached
the table again, her grandfather had not yet come in,
but he appeared almost instantly, with a tall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
freckled girl hanging on his arm&mdash;a girl with a turned-up
nose and a bronzed pigtail the size of her doubled
fist hanging down her back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Granddaddy Swift,&quot; she was saying, earnestly,
&quot;don&#39;t you see that I can&#39;t come and meet a
brand-new city granddaughter, and sit down to a
respectable person&#39;s dinner table, attired in a bloomer
suit? Don&#39;t you know it isn&#39;t done in the circles
in which we move? Make him let go of my ear,
Grandmummy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth rose shyly, and then she sat down again,
but the stranger eluded Grandfather&#39;s masterful grip,
and slipped around to her side, with a hand out-stretched
in greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t he dreadful?&quot; she said, indicating her tormentor
affectionately. &quot;When I heard you were
here, I was going back to the cottage, to put on my
best bib and tucker and make a proper call upon
you, but Granddaddy wouldn&#39;t hear of it. He insisted
on dragging me hither by the hair. So here
I am&mdash;Peggy Farraday, at your service, and am
very glad to meet you, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad to meet you,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I
haven&#39;t seen any girls for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The woods down here are full of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I guess I haven&#39;t been into the woods very
much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth ain&#39;t a tomboy, like you, into everybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
else&#39;s business, all day long. She stays at home
with me and Gra&#39;ma, and minds her p&#39;s and q&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we&#39;ll change all that. Attractive as you
and Grandmummy are, you can&#39;t expect to monopolize
her forever. Now it&#39;s my turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth saw that both her grandfather and grandmother
were beaming at this tall girl&#39;s impulsive
chattering. She felt her own stiffness relaxing under
the sunny influence of the stranger&#39;s smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I adopted Grandmummy and Granddaddy three
years ago, when I came over to this ducky old house,
on my very first day on the Cape, to beg a pint of
milk and a pail of water for my hungry, unkempt
family. I saw that they were just the grandparents
I was looking for, and so I took them on, and I&#39;ve
been the plague of their existence every summer
since. Haven&#39;t I, Granddaddy? Isn&#39;t he a lamb?
You know, my one ambition is to squeeze him to
pieces, but he&#39;s so woolly and scratchy and cantankerous,
that it&#39;s almost impossible to get your arms
around him, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Elizabeth said, crimsoning, with a
quick glance at her grandfather.</p>

<p class="indent">To her surprise, he took no notice of her discomfiture.
Both he and Grandmother seemed unaware
of the delicate ground upon which Miss Peggy
Farraday had set her enthusiastic little heels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m fifteen,&quot; that young lady continued, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
very little pause either between her mouthfuls of
food or of conversation&mdash;&quot;You&#39;re fourteen, aren&#39;t
you? I had more fun the year I was fourteen than
I ever had before, or ever expect to have again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be fourteen next Thursday,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took on an entirely new character the day I
was fourteen. I became very sedate and dignified,
and changed my name from Peg to Peggy. Do
you expect to do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think perhaps I shall,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I guess
my character does need improving.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She expected some retort from her grandfather at
this, but he only held out his hand for her plate, and
heaped it high with roast lamb and tender green
peas from the kitchen garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I envy you the scrumptious things you have to
eat all the time over here. We bring our fat cook
down with us. She cooks all right in town in the
winter, but she always sulks on Cape Cod, and we
have a dreadful time getting anything. We&#39;re not
lucky enough to have Judidy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; that flattered young lady protested.
&quot;Land, think of anybody feeling lucky to have
me! I <i>kin</i> cook, though, whenever Mis&#39; Swift is
willing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, she don&#39;t let our help do much work.
She&#39;s afraid they&#39;d get the habit, and kinder get in
her way whenever she wanted to make a day of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
When she&#39;s cooking, Judidy she generally sets down
and reads the newspaper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so fat,&quot; Judidy explained, &quot;that I kinder
make hard work getting around.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To Elizabeth&#39;s surprise, Peggy Farraday went off
into peals and spasms of laughter at this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are such loves,&quot; she explained. &quot;They
are such darlings! I adore the way they do things.
Grandmummy&mdash;I call her that, because she was
jealous of Granddaddy for a name&mdash;is a lot like the
Peterkins in her domestic arrangements.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ought to be like Elizabeth Eliza. That&#39;s my
name.&quot; Elizabeth was glad that she had read the
&quot;Peterkin Papers&quot; with Buddy the summer before.
She had never met any other girl who was familiar
with them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later what character in fiction I think
you&#39;re like. It takes me a while to make up my mind
about things like that. I seem to jump at conclusions
a good deal quicker than I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you always tell whether you like people or
not, at first meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I can. Can&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy looked up quickly, and then her eyes dropped
to her plate and she began eating rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s shy, too,&quot; Elizabeth thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you&#39;ll come upstairs after dinner,&quot; she said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
aloud, &quot;I&#39;ve got something I want to show you.
You&#39;ve come just in time to give me your advice
about something pretty exciting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she was leaving the dining room something
made her turn and look back at her grandmother,
who was smiling broadly to herself, like the Cheshire
cat in &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The something I was going to show you was <i>her</i>
surprise to me,&quot; Elizabeth whispered to Peggy.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">The Birthday</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth sat in her little blue room, and
shivered.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the afternoon of her birthday, and
although she hadn&#39;t mentioned the fact to any one,
she had dressed herself to do honour to the occasion.
Every undergarment, chemise, camisole, and petticoat,
was of a soft, flesh-tinted silk. Her dress was
of the finest white muslin trimmed only with infinitesimal
tucks and Valenciennes beading, and she
was wearing a blue ribbon sash with a big butterfly
bow at the back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My pride ought to keep me warm,&quot; she thought,
&quot;what a pity it doesn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before she bought her silken lingerie she had
deliberated a long time between that magnificence
and a light blue wool sweater and had finally succumbed
to the lure of the lacy garments which had
taken every penny of her month&#39;s allowance and all
that she was allowed to borrow on her next.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked around her room with a glow of satisfaction,
having only that morning put the finishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
touches on it. She had draped the windows with
an old-fashioned print, a blue groundwork with
tiny pink roses wandering over it, that her grandmother
had produced from an ancient chest stored
with remnants of the popular fabrics of an older
generation. The furniture she had chosen was
mostly painted black, or a very dark stain. She
had found another flag-bottomed chair, a twin to
the first, and a wonderful old settee on rockers, which
had a deep seat with an adjustable rack running
along the outside of it, as if to prevent its being used
except for the one person who chose to sit in the space
that was clear at the end. This she had piled with
cushions made from little square pillows that her
grandmother kept for &quot;children who came a-visiting.&quot;
Her desk and her spinning wheel were in opposite
comers, and a miniature organ, the keyboard of
which comprised two octaves exactly, occupied
a position under the eaves between the two farther
windows.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning mail had brought her a writing-case
from her mother, a check for five dollars from her
father, and a letter, her first, from her Buddy. She
had taken a high resolution not to shed one tear on
her birthday, and the mild faces of Faith and Charity
smiled down on her as if to strengthen her will.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hope looks a little teary, herself,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sound of altercation on the stairway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
that led directly out of the passage from the dining
room of her new suite.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>shall</i> come upstairs, Grandmummy, and
give it to her yourself. She doesn&#39;t want your present
by way of me. She wants it handed out, with
your own personal and private blessing. Besides,
I&#39;ve got a present for her myself. I can&#39;t give her
two presents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy Farraday, with her hands sternly set on
Grandmother Swift&#39;s shoulders, marched her firmly
into Elizabeth&#39;s chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s Grandmummy with a beautiful present
for your birthday. She was going to send it upstairs
by me, but I declined the honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young folks like to open packages by themselves,
without anybody standing around counting the Ohs
and Ahs, and waiting to be thanked for something
that may not exactly suit. If Elizabeth likes what
I&#39;ve made her, I guess she can make out to tell me
so.&quot; Grandmother, entirely unruffled by the recent
coercion to which she had been submitted, put down
a bulky tissue-wrapped package and departed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t she funny?&quot; Peggy said. &quot;But do open
it. I can hardly wait to see what you think of it.
It&#39;s copied from one of mine, the only sweater I&#39;ve
ever really loved. And it&#39;s in your colour, and everything.&quot;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;Do open it. I can hardly wait to see what you think of it.&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth, scarcely crediting her senses, shook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
out from the folds of tissue the lovely, fleecy garment
of her dreams, a wool sweater in her own colour
of &quot;Heaven&#39;s blue.&quot; She gave it one comprehensive
glance, then she slipped after her grandmother,
caught up with her halfway down the stairs, and
kissed her on the nape of an astonished neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re not a grandmother, you&#39;re an angel,&quot;
she said, and flew back, in a panic, to Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s my present,&quot; that young lady informed
her. &quot;It&#39;s something very practical, but I made it
myself. I thought you might like it. I always
give away the kind of thing I adore, don&#39;t you?
That&#39;s doing the very best you can to show love&mdash;and
one person&#39;s sure to be suited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a laundry bag,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;and I
haven&#39;t got one. You dear.&quot; She put out her hand
toward Peggy, and missed her. Then they both put
out their hands together, and kissed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The beauty of this creation is that you don&#39;t
have to fish down into it,&quot; Peggy explained. &quot;It
buttons all the way across the bottom, and can
be dumped that way. I made the buttonholes
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it&#39;s my colour, too. Have you made this
since you were here last week?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I made it the first week I came down, to be
sure to have it ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before you even saw me. How did you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
you&#39;d like me well enough to give it to me when it
was done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was willing to take my chances. When I heard
about your brother being sick, and your disappointment
about the cottage, I thought you might be
feeling kind of low when you first got here. So I
prepared for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How kind you are! How kind everybody is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t get the weeps. See here, do you
know what this bar on this settee was put on for?
It&#39;s a kind of a cradle arrangement. Mother makes
up baby&#39;s bed on the lower end, puts up the bar,
sits herself up at the head, and rocks and knits.
Grandmother told me. She was rocked there herself
when she was a baby. She remembers having
scarlet fever on it. Aren&#39;t these old things fascinating?
You&#39;re an awfully lucky girl to have grandparents
like this. Mine live in a Back Bay apartment,
and are just like everybody else, only a lot
more so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a lot nicer than I am,&quot; Elizabeth said,
suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have such nice clothes. I thought
you might like this clo&#39;, though.&quot; Peggy stood up
to be admired. &quot;It&#39;s my best bib and tucker. See,
this is the bib,&quot; she indicated the square of cobwebby
lace and lawn under her bronze chin, &quot;and this is
the tucker.&quot; She turned around, to show its counterpart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
in the back. &quot;That&#39;s really what I bought it
for, I couldn&#39;t decide between this pink linen and
a gray dotted swiss until I realized that this was a
bib and tucker. Which of course settled it at once.
By the way, I know something very funny.&quot; Peggy
barely took a breath between sentences. &quot;I wonder
if you know it, too. My sister Ruth knows your
brother John quite well. They wrote to each other
all the time that he was abroad. I just found out
that he was your brother by the merest accident.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean that Ruth Farraday is your sister!
Why, Buddy&#39;s known her for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t he have known my sister for years?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I suppose so, but it doesn&#39;t seem possible.
I thought he met that girl in Boston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I live in Boston. If you&#39;ve got a sample of your
brother&#39;s handwriting, I can prove to you that my
Ruth is the girl. I&#39;ve taken in his letters for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth produced the precious morning missive
by the simple process of diving into the neck of her
blouse. Peggy bent over the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the same,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, is he going to
be an awful lot better soon? Ruthie has been dreadfully
worried, I know, though she hasn&#39;t said much
about it. She&#39;s the still member of the family, you
see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she look like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she&#39;s darlingly pretty, with great blue eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
and long golden lashes, and lovely colour that comes
and goes, and she dresses sort of quaintly. She looks
well in fringes and sashes and droopy things. I
have to wear boys&#39; clothes, almost, to set off my
peculiar style of beauty, but you mustn&#39;t judge
Ruthie by me. She&#39;s really a star.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I&#39;d like you best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you wouldn&#39;t if you could see Ruth. You&#39;d
just call for the incense and get busy worshipping.
Everybody does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she many suitors?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Flocks and herds of them, but she doesn&#39;t care.
She&#39;s kind of booky and dreamy. I don&#39;t mean she
doesn&#39;t play a stunning game of tennis, and drive a
car, and all that. She was motor corps for a while,
and just crazy to get over, but Dad wouldn&#39;t hear of
it. She&#39;ll be on the Cape bye and bye, and you can
judge for yourself&mdash;I&#39;m going to stay to supper, did
you know it? Your grandmother sent over and invited
me yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know she even remembered my birthday,
and now&mdash;only think!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said to me that you were as blue as indigo,
and putting up a good old struggle not to be, and she
wanted you to have something pleasant to remember.
That festive sound from below stairs is Judidy taking
her turn at the handle of the ice-cream freezer. Do
you know what they make the ice-cream of here?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Just pure Jersey cream and fruit juice. I never
tasted anything like it in my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t I hear something outside the door? It
sounded just as if somebody had crept up and then
crept away again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t hear anything.&quot; Peggy threw open the
door like a flash. &quot;It <i>was</i> someone. More birthday
surprises.&quot; She held up the package that an unseen
hand had deposited on the threshold. &quot;Open it
quick, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it&#39;s the Kipling &#39;Birthday Book,&#39;&quot; Elizabeth
said, &quot;that red-leather edition that I&#39;ve been crazy
for. Who do you suppose could have got it for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is there left to give you a present?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandpa hasn&#39;t been heard from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandpa?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s capable of anything. You don&#39;t half
appreciate him, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know I don&#39;t, Peggy, but I think I&#39;m beginning
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the supper table they cornered him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he admitted to Peggy, &quot;I didn&#39;t know as
you was upstairs, and I calculated to have Elizabeth
blame it on you, but seeing as I&#39;m caught, I&#39;ll own up
to what I can&#39;t hide. I asked that girl in the apothecary
shop in Hyannis what was the best kind of a
birthday present, and she said a birthday book. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
thought that was likely, so I asked to see one. She
fetched out a Longfeller book and a Emerson book,
and then I see this one standing all alone in a corner,
and I took to it right away. Kipling, he writes about
things I know something about. So I took him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are going to put your name in the book
the first thing&mdash;before any one,&quot; Elizabeth declared:
&quot;What&#39;s your birthday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What day is to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The thirtieth of June.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean that you were born on my birthday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always kind o&#39; calculated you were born on
mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Judidy, attired in a purple and yellow silk
gown over which she wore a black silk apron embroidered
in blue forget-me-nots, rose to change the
plates, with an expression of the most intense self-consciousness,
Grandmother rose also, and the two
exchanged signals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I understood dumb show a little better,&quot;
Grandfather said, slyly, &quot;I might be inclined to think
that Mother had something hid out in the kitchen,
and Judidy had an errand in the pantry, but o&#39; course
I probably got it all mixed up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; Grandmother smiled, &quot;seeing as the same
thing has come o&#39; the pantry every June thirtieth for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
forty-five years, it ain&#39;t anyways likely that you
know anything about it.&quot; She bustled off to the
kitchen, to reappear with a mound of ice-cream in
which the strawberries were embedded, like so many
perfect emeries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like ice-cream better than anything in the
world,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like it better than fathers and mothers and
sisters and intimate friends, but not better than
grandparents, especially not grandparents when one
of them is celebrating its birthday,&quot; Peggy declared,
&quot;Now, I&#39;m getting silly. Will somebody stop me,
please? Oh, look! Look at Judidy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That flushed and excited young woman was approaching
the table with the air of a standard bearer.
In her arms she carried a big tray lined with white
paper lace, and on it was set a marvellous erection of
cake&mdash;a big round of chocolate confection lettered in
pink, and further adorned by blazing pink candles.
She placed it in front of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Time was when I had a cake to myself on my
birthday,&quot; Grandfather grumbled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The time ain&#39;t so fur off.&quot; Grandmother appeared,
with a round loaf of fruit cake on which one
candle burned brightly. &quot;You can take the candle
right off if you want to. I only put it on for a joke.
The cake is just what I always bake for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth can eat all the candle grease.&quot; Grandfather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
made an effort to frown, in which he succeeded
only indifferently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I made it myself,&quot; Judidy cried, as Elizabeth
counted her candles, &quot;fourteen, and one to grow on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And did you make all the letters&mdash;&#39;Elizabeth
With Love?&#39;&mdash;I think that&#39;s the nicest thing any
birthday cake ever said on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was going to put on &#39;Elizabeth-aged-fourteen,&#39;
and then I thought that the candles would tell how
old you were,&quot; the blushing Judidy hovered over her
masterpiece, &quot;and then I thought it was better to put
on a kind of a message. I couldn&#39;t write a very long
one, but I guess that says just as much as a whole
sheet of paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you make the letters so clear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With a cornycopia. You colour your white
frosting with strawberry juice, and then you make
this here cornycopia out of letter paper, and then you
sort of dribble it along and write with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks lovely,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Thank you.
Thank you, Judidy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t let your ice-cream melt,&quot; Peggy warned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t let yours melt,&quot; Grandmother said,
putting out her hand for the empty dish Peggy was
waving.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never had all the ice-cream I wanted,&quot; Peggy
acknowledged, sadly. &quot;I never shall have, I know I
shan&#39;t, because I can&#39;t hold it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
When Elizabeth made her wish, and blew out her
candles, tears of pure delight stood in Judidy&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve give you luck,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, I hope it was
a good wish!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the best wish anybody could wish,&quot;
Elizabeth smiled. &quot;I shall never forget this birthday,
and this cake, Judidy, nor any of the dear things that
have been done for me.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That night, as her grandmother tucked her into bed,
she caught one of the kindly hands and clung to it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was the most beautiful sweater in all the
world,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you think I could go down and
kiss Grandfather good-night, too?&quot; she asked, shyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it could be managed. I&#39;ll go downstairs
with you, and see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And presently Grandfather, with his glasses sitting
low on his nose, and his nose in the morning paper,
was attacked from behind and kissed breathlessly;
but when Elizabeth tried to escape, she found herself
caught by a blue dimity sleeve, and drawn into an
energetic embrace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you don&#39;t,&quot; he said, placing her on his
knee. &quot;You&#39;re going to set here a while, and talk to
Grandpa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the eminence of his knee proved such an embarrassing
vantage ground that he soon let her go.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night,&quot; she said, slipping her hand into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
his. &quot;Good-night, Granddaddy, dear,&quot; and she kissed
him again, a real kiss this time, as if he were her
father, or Buddy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well,&quot; he said, &quot;well, well!&quot; and sat holding
her by the shoulders so long that he almost seemed to
have forgotten she was there. Then he picked her up
in his arms and carried her up the stairs again, tucking
her into bed with a hand as accustomed as
Grandma&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen years old and letting her grandfather
put her to bed the way he did when she was a baby.
Ain&#39;t you ashamed?&quot; he asked, playfully, in a tone
she had never heard him use before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I&#39;m proud,&quot; Elizabeth said, and she meant it.</p>

<p class="indent">Under her pillow was her brother&#39;s letter, and she
lit a flickering bedside lamp to read it by before she
went finally to sleep. It was a short letter, slanting
down the paper, as he was not yet able to sit up in
his bed long enough to write properly. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sister-on-her-birthday</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;d be willing to eat a German helmet to be able to spend this
day with you. But the U. S. base hospital&mdash;base is the word&mdash;has
got me for the present. I send you my respects, and fourteen
and one half kisses to grow on.</p>

<p class="indent">For the love of Michael, don&#39;t get priggish in your old age.
Some of your letters have made me wonder if there was nobody
home where my sister lived, but lately they&#39;ve seemed more the
real thing. Get acquainted with your grandfather and grandmother.
Grandfather once told me that he had come to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
conclusion there was only one person in the world he had to keep
an eye on, and that was himself. Good talk, Sis.</p>

<p class="indent">Which endeth the lesson.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Buddy.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">As she tucked the letter back in its envelope,
she realized that the sheet which had been wrapped
around it to prevent its scrawly surface from showing
through the transparent envelope was not blank as
she had at first supposed; she spread it out before her,
thinking to find a postscript to her own letter, but it
was not that. It was evidently a sheet of a letter
begun and discarded. Elizabeth had read it before
she realized that it was not meant for her eyes to see.
&quot;Sweetheart&mdash;Sweetheart&mdash;Sweetheart&mdash;&quot; it ran, &quot;I
have never called you this, and I have no right to call
you so now, or any other name. At least, not for
many years to come. I&#39;m done for. I love you, and I
can&#39;t try for you. That&#39;s something the war has done
for a lot&mdash;more&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Here it broke off, abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Buddy, Buddy,&quot; Elizabeth cried, &quot;I didn&#39;t
mean to snoop. How perfectly, perfectly terrible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was two in the morning before she slept. She
lay wide eyed in the darkness, thinking of her brother
and Peggy Farraday&#39;s sister. It couldn&#39;t be anybody
else&mdash;she knew that much about Buddy. For
the first time in her life she was feeling the weight of
a trouble that did not make her want to cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that&#39;s what it means to be fourteen and
grown up,&quot; she said.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Ninety-Nine Negroes</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peggy and Elizabeth were lying on the beach
in their bathing suits. Peggy had hollowed
out a careful seat in the sand, and built arm
rests and a slanting support for the head, which she
was trying to recline on and enjoy. Elizabeth, who
had made no such elaborate preparations for relaxation,
was really comfortable. She was wearing a
black mohair suit with a patent leather belt and silk
stockings, and a blue rubber cap put on with great
care, so that tendrils of soft brown hair framed her
face. Peggy wore a rubber diving cap that made her
look as if she had been scalped, but her blue jersey
suit was trimmed with blue and green stripes and
slashed up the side and laced fetchingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you get your birthday wish, or did you wish
for a handsome husband in the sweet bye and bye?&quot;
Peggy asked, lazily. &quot;I always wish for things that
will happen right away, because I can&#39;t stand the
strain of not knowing whether I&#39;m going to get them
or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t wish to get anything. I wished to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
something. I can&#39;t tell yet whether I&#39;m going to
succeed in being it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know&mdash;occasions like that always make
you feel noble, but I hate to waste a wish on wanting
to be a better girl. You can&#39;t tell your wish, and if
you don&#39;t, there&#39;s nobody that can judge whether
you&#39;ve got it or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t we judge for ourselves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose we can, but it&#39;s kind of embarrassing
to award yourself prizes for virtue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it, but in a kind of general way you have
to keep tabs on your own piggishness, because you&#39;re
the only one that can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you say pig or fig?&quot; Peggy had all of &quot;Alice
in Wonderland&quot; on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said pig, but I guess prig was what I meant,
really. You&#39;re not a prig&mdash;but I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, speaking of wishes,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;do you
know the very latest way of telling who you&#39;ll marry?
You count ninety-nine niggers, twenty-seven white
horses, and three red-heads, and then the next man
you shake hands with, you&#39;ll marry. Let&#39;s begin
and do it. I&#39;ve been meaning to for a long time,
but I wanted to wait until I had somebody to
do it with. Those things are not so much fun alone.
Kindly remove that inquisitive sand flea from my
back. Oh! Ouch! Lots of people claim they don&#39;t
bite.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
Elizabeth took the offender between thumb and
forefinger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a funny looking beastie,&quot; she said. &quot;He&#39;s
got a kind of solemn, long face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he looks interrupted,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;I guess
he liked my flavour. Shall we start counting to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There aren&#39;t many Negroes on the Cape, unless
you count Portuguese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are two kinds of Portuguese&mdash;black
Portuguese and white Portuguese. We&#39;ll have to
count the black ones. My mother once went to the
Azores&mdash;that&#39;s inhabited by Portuguese, you know&mdash;she
says that the high-class women all wear a kind of
nun&#39;s costume, with a huge black head-dress made
exactly like a pea-pod, and they are all quite light-skinned
in spite of their black hair and eyes. Well,
let&#39;s go in swimming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth swam her hundred strokes, and then
stood breast high, watching Peggy&#39;s fearless performance
as that young person displayed all the
latest spectacular swimming feats, diving and wallowing
and spouting like a young whale. The raft,
which was usually rocking in at least seven feet of
water, had at first filled Elizabeth with terror, but
Peggy&#39;s adventurous spirit was beginning to animate
her, and she followed courageously when Peggy
cried, &quot;Now, the raft,&quot; and climbed up its slippery
sides with very little hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
&quot;You&#39;re an amphibious animal,&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;I don&#39;t just know what kind, but I do know what
your mind is like&mdash;the way it flies around, up one
thing and down another. It&#39;s exactly like a squirrel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s a compliment or
not. Look who&#39;s here, Elizabeth. A little fish, see.
A perfectly good fish. I wonder how he got here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he dead?&quot; Elizabeth asked, shrinking a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s either dead or sleeping. I think he&#39;s alive.
He hasn&#39;t any eyes, that&#39;s his trouble. Let&#39;s put
him back in the water&mdash;but let&#39;s wish on him first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;I know a
perfectly lovely poem out of the Kipling book. I&#39;ll
try it on the poor little thing.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Little blind fish, thou art marvelous wise.</span>
<span class="i0">Little blind fish, who put out thine eyes?</span>
<span class="i0">Open thy eyes, while I whisper my wish;</span>
<span class="i0">Bring me a lover, thou little blind fish.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;He couldn&#39;t very well open his eyes, on account
of never having any, but I guess he got the general
idea. Back you go into the water, you little blind
fish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wish, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did&mdash;one of my next week wishes. You know
how they tell your fortune with cards. &#39;What you
expect, What you don&#39;t expect, What&#39;s sure to come
true. Next week.&#39; My wishes are all on that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
principle. There goes fishie, swimming away for
dear life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring me a lover, thou little blind fish.&quot; The
raft was rocking gently under a fleece-lined sky, and
the water was blue-green and full of little thrills and
ripples. Peggy took off her cap, and let her black
hair stream on the breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you ever thought much about lovers?&quot;
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy blushed. &quot;Have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not about my own. That is, I mean not about
anybody I ever knew or saw, but have you ever
thought about anybody else having a lover? Any
relation of yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About Ruthie, yes, but I don&#39;t believe she would
ever really care about that. Except in a very friendly
way. All the engaged people I ever knew were so
mushy! I can&#39;t imagine Ruth being mushy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never think about the engaged people I know.
That isn&#39;t what I call being engaged&mdash;the way people
<i>are</i> engaged. I always think of the way people in
books get engaged, and that makes it easier to
imagine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it does. That would be the only way Ruth
would ever do it. But I don&#39;t think she would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think she would be the kind of girl to get
engaged by letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t like to think about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
her getting engaged. She&#39;s too useful around the
house. You wouldn&#39;t like to think of your brother
being engaged, would you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might, if he were very unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t you worry about your brother being
unhappy. The thing about being grown up is that
you can do just about what you please. If a man
wants to get married, he can do it, when he&#39;s as old
as that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There might be things to prevent him&mdash;health
and things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, I wouldn&#39;t worry about my brother and any
girl if I were you. He isn&#39;t the marrying kind. I
heard Sister tell Mother that. Mother was quizzing
her, I guess; you know how mothers are about this
suitor proposition. Well, Ruth said that John Swift
was the one man she knew that was perfectly satisfied
to be a friend, and a good friend to a girl, and that he
had told her so. She said she had a perfectly tranquil,
lovely friendship with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; Elizabeth thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy has got a very beautiful nature,&quot; she
said aloud. &quot;I think a girl of his own age would
like him very much, and he would make a good
friend to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruth would make the best little friend in the
world. I think friendship is much more beautiful
than love. I don&#39;t think I should altogether like it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
if my sister and your brother were the other kind,
and wanted to behave, well, you know&mdash;that way.
Would you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Elizabeth, faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home she was very silent, while Peggy
chattered, but at her own gate she looked at her
friend speculatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, Peggy,&quot; she said, &quot;that there are
ways in which I feel a whole lot older than you are?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are there?&quot; said Peggy, uncertainly. &quot;Look,
Elizabeth, there&#39;s the third Negro. I&#39;ll bet we&#39;ll
really get our fate settled before the summer is over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon Elizabeth took her knitting&mdash;she
was making a scarf for Buddy, who had demanded
one to bind himself round, soldier fashion, during
the period of his anticipated convalescence on Cape
Cod&mdash;and sat in Grandfather&#39;s chair by the living-room
window. Her grandmother was darning stockings
on the other side of the branching fern. Elizabeth&#39;s
knitting would have progressed more rapidly
if she had not been keeping a sharp eye on the street,
in order that no Negroes should escape her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever do any stunts to see who you would
marry?&quot; she asked her grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My sister and I used to hang horseshoes over the
door, and the first one that passed under them was
supposed to be the one we was going to marry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did somebody pass under?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;We did it a good many times. I remember one
time we did it, and the first one that passed under
was to be my husband, and the second was to be
Alviry&#39;s. The first one turned out to be young
Pork Joe, who was one o&#39; the unlikeliest boys that
ever put his waistcoat on hind-side before; he never
would dress himself proper. I was pretty well
discouraged at the idea of young Pork Joe for a
husband, but Alviry she made me hang around watching
for her beau to turn up, and lo and behold the
very next person to set foot over that threshold was
your grandfather. I thought I felt bad enough
before, but when I saw John Swift&#39;s shoulders thrusting
themselves through that door frame, I just
bolted off upstairs and had a good cry. Alviry she
wasn&#39;t pleased, either. She had her eye on Martin
Nickerson at the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe it was the second one you were to marry,
and the first didn&#39;t count. Who was young Pork
Joe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Old Pork Joe&#39;s son. He used to keep pigs to
sell, and so they finally got calling him that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The way they call the plumber Pump Peter. I
think Cape Cod is the funniest place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ain&#39;t so different from other places.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In other places you don&#39;t associate so much
with&mdash;the baker and the butcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe they ain&#39;t so well worth associating with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
&quot;My friend Jeanie Forsyth is a direct descendant
from the <i>Mayflower</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, so&#39;re you. Don&#39;t you know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have we really got <i>Mayflower</i> blood?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those old pewter spoons on the dining-room
mantle, that you was examining the other day, was
made from a mold that Peregrine White brought over
on the <i>Mayflower</i>. My mother was a White, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know. I guess I don&#39;t know much about
anything, Grandmother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Live and learn. Babies ain&#39;t born with any
great amount of contrivance, nor yet much of an
idea of what&#39;s what.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve learned a lot since I&#39;ve been down here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ain&#39;t so sure as you was about the way things
was meant to be. At first, we&#39;re pretty sure that
things was meant to be just one way, and that way
the one we&#39;ve picked out. After living along a while,
we get to realize that the other feller has his way, too.
Then we have to kinder arrange our ideas again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy thinks I&#39;m a snob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I think Buddy&#39;s right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he ain&#39;t going to be right very long if you
<i>think</i> so. When I was growing up, I used to have a
stylish city friend that I spent a good deal of time
with. She was the daughter of the biggest man we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
had had from these parts, and she used to spend her
summers at home, in the big white house on Main
Street&mdash;the one with the pillars and the cedar hedge,
just opposite the post office. She used to get her
dresses from Paris, and let me make copies of them,
too, and she was courted by a member of the governor&#39;s
staff. I don&#39;t know as she ever had a brother-in-law
that was a count&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Grandmother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, let Grandma have her joke&mdash;as long as she
can keep Grandpa quiet. Well, when we was little
girls, she used to love to go to my grandma&#39;s with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Grandmother Elspeth&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my grandmother; Grandmother White. Well,
Mary&#39;s folks mostly lived away from here, and most
of the ways and doings of home folks was a novelty
to her. She liked to get Grandma telling about
old times on Cape Cod. You see, when Grandmother
was a little girl, her mother was bedridden,
and the whole family was taken care of by her and a
neighbour&#39;s daughter, a little girl called Hopey D.&mdash;I
never knew what the rest of her name was. As fast
as the babies come along, they was put in the old
settee cradle, and she and Hopey used to have to
change places sitting and rocking there all the time
they wasn&#39;t doing housework. That&#39;s the same
settee you got in your room upstairs. Grandma
used to tell how the fire would go out in the old fireplace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
on account of she and Hopey not keeping it
going right. Those were the days before matches, you
know; and she used to have to run through the woods
to the nearest neighbour, who lived a mile away, to
borrow fire and bring it home in a swinging pail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;Oh, that doesn&#39;t seem
possible. I thought that the days before matches
were way back in Columbus&#39;s time, or something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I&#39;ve got a piece o&#39; flint and a tinder box
upstairs somewhere that came from Grandma&#39;s.
Supposing you had to strike a spark from a piece o&#39;
flint before you could get the kettle to boiling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing I had a bedridden mother, like poor
Grandma White. Oh, I hope that Hopey D. was a
nice little girl, and that she and great&mdash;no, great-great-grandmother
had good times together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When Grandma used to tell all those old stories
to my stylish friend, do you know how I felt? I felt
mortified at having a grandma that wasn&#39;t more high
toned, and I used to try to get Mary not to go there,
so&#39;s we wouldn&#39;t have no more talk about running
after a pail of fire, and rocking babies on the old settee
and such.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth bent her head over her knitting, and
the colour mounted slowly to her forehead, but she
did not speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you see, girl nature is pretty much girl nature,
wherever you find it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;I was going to write a letter to-night, Grandmother,&quot;
Elizabeth said, after a period of silence,
&quot;and it wasn&#39;t going to be a very nice kind of a letter,
because it&mdash;it was going to misrepresent things some.
Now, I am going to write entirely differently, because
things you&#39;ve been saying have set me to thinking.
I&#39;d be willing to show you the letter, if you thought
you ought to see it,&quot; she added, anxiously, but her
grandmother only smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t never very particular about reading other
folks&#39; letters,&quot; she said. &quot;I have trouble enough
reading those I write myself, and those that is sent
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Elizabeth said, in a very small voice,
&quot;I guess it&#39;s going to be hard enough to write it,
anyway.&quot; This was the fateful epistle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jeanie</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I want to begin by correcting an impression I was snobby
enough to give you when I first came down here. I wrote you
about this place and my grandparents in an entirely false way.
I did it because I was too proud to own up the truth. I was
surprised and shocked when I got here, to find how things really
were. I hadn&#39;t been here since I was a little girl, and then only
for very brief visits. I imagined a kind of Farm de-luxe and a
grandmother in real lace and mitts, and a kind of Lord Chesterfieldian
grandfather, and all the comforts of a chteau. Instead,
my dear Granddaddy and dearest Grandmother are just&mdash;natives.
They murder the President&#39;s English, and they sit around in their
shirt sleeves&mdash;the former, not the latter&mdash;and they, well, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
aren&#39;t like anything I&#39;ve ever known. So I got started pretending,
in my letters to you, and kept right on. The &quot;car&quot; is an
old, rattletrap Ford, and Granddaddy drives it in his suspenders
when he wants to. The chauffeur I sort of gave you the impression
we had is a regular, farm hired man. Our hired girl sits
at the table with us, and she is nice, too. They are all nice, nice
people&mdash;nicer than I am. My grandmother is beautiful looking.
I wish you could see her. I didn&#39;t care for any one to see her,
for a while. Now, I am getting anxious for everyone to.</p>

<p class="indent">Jeanie, can you understand me or not? I&#39;m just a prig, snob,
liar, and I don&#39;t feel fit to live. I don&#39;t know what got into me.
I always tell you everything, and now I deliberately did this
awful thing, and I&#39;ve got something else that I can&#39;t tell you, but
that is not my secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Can you love me any more? I ask this seriously, because I
know you won&#39;t mind my humble origin half as much as the
deception. I knew this all the time, and yet I could not seem to
help the way I was behaving.</p>

<p class="indent">I am afraid to read your letter in answer to this, so don&#39;t write
me one. Let me hear from you by return mail, but don&#39;t say
anything, not much, about this anyway. If you love me, though,
please begin your letter by saying so. I don&#39;t deserve you for my
most intimate friend. I&#39;ve taken a new name. My great-grandmother&#39;s
name, and I am going to live up to it. I took it
so to be thoroughly part of my family, and to cultivate the old-fashioned
virtues with. It&#39;s</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Elspeth</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">P. S.&mdash;Call me by it. Everything I told you about my birthday
was so. They did all those beautiful things for me. I
slightly camouflaged details, but it was all the way I said, except
that Judidy <i>ate</i> with us. Aren&#39;t I a pig?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Elspeth</span> again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">The Bean Supper</span></p>

<p class="indent">The three Steppe children stood in the centre
aisle of the local department store, in a state
of unembarrassed good humour, while Peggy
and Elizabeth drew apart in consultation. The
saleswoman busied herself with folding up a series of
small garments that had been discussed and rejected
by the two young shoppers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Six dollars and thirty-three cents, and a stamp.&quot;
Elizabeth counted the contents of her purse again,
distractedly. &quot;Your three dollars and my three,
and the thirty-three cents we both saved on ice-cream
cones, and the stamp makes it thirty-five.
I had no idea that children&#39;s clothes were so expensive.
We can hardly buy shoes for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they can&#39;t go to that supper unless they
have shoes. Look at their feet, Elizabeth&mdash;I mean
Elspeth&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it,&quot; Elizabeth said, colloquially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to go to bean supper,&quot; Madget wailed.
&quot;I said I would go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush up, Baby,&quot; Mabel warned her, &quot;you&#39;re in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
apartment store. The lady will throw you right out
the door if you don&#39;t be good and quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget turned large, disturbed eyes on the lady
indicated, and discovered in her calm countenance
nothing to rouse alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to go to bean supper!&quot; she wailed, even
louder than before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have some laced canvas shoes with rubber
bottoms that are a dollar and a dollar and a half,&quot;
the clerk volunteered. &quot;You might get them for
the little girls, and a pair of sneakers for the boy.
We have them in black and brown,&quot; she added, with
a hasty glance toward the grimy toes and scratched
ankles protruding from his nondescript footwear.
&quot;We have stockings and socks that are reasonable,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, let&#39;s get their feet covered,&quot; Peggy said,
&quot;and trust to luck for the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget and Mabel were accordingly fitted to
brown shoes and socks and Moses to black sneakers
and long, black ribbed stockings. Nothing that could
be said to him, even the argument of the financial
inconvenience of covering his long legs, would induce
him to put on socks like those of his sisters. It was
stockings or nothing with Moses, though he was perfectly
willing to do without them entirely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One dollar and eight cents. Could we buy this
little boy any kind of trousers or bloomers for that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
do you suppose? You wouldn&#39;t mind taking a
stamp to make up the difference, would you?&quot; Peggy
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the least. We have some khaki bloomers
that might fit him for seventy-five cents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t agoing to wear bloomers,&quot; Moses said,
decisively. &quot;I want pants or nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is what you&#39;ve got on now,&quot; Peggy said,
severely, &quot;or very near nothing. You can&#39;t go to
that bean supper in rags, you know. Don&#39;t you
want to have some cake and ice-cream, and corned
beef&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And potato salud,&quot; Mabel put in, helpfully, &quot;and
beans&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And ice-cream and cake and potato salud,&quot;
Madget droned, &quot;and coffee and ice-cream and
cake&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said that before,&quot; Moses said. &quot;Don&#39;t you
ever get tired of hearing things over and over?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can get a Butterick pattern and make him a
shirt,&quot; Peggy suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can get Grandmother to give us some cambric
and things to make the little girls dresses. See
here, Moses, you&#39;ve just got to have a pair of those
bloomers. All boys wear them. You can&#39;t go to
the supper if you don&#39;t&mdash;&mdash; Do you mind measuring
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moses stood up and was measured; and five dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
went into the cash drawer of the Hamlin Department
Store, while the two girls, laden with their purchases,
steered their young charges toward home.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother produced goods enough to make
Moses a blouse of brown striped shirting and each
of the little girls a print dress. She also found some
old petticoats, yellowed with age, but daintily made,
and some waists with which they could be worn,
complete to the very last button.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So far, so good,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;but we&#39;ve got
to hustle to get this family covered before five
o&#39;clock to-morrow night. Moses&#39; shirt is going to
be the worst. The dresses we can mostly make on
the sewing machine. You play around here in the
yard all day to-morrow, children, so we can try on
the things whenever we need you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They started with their dressmaking bright and
early the next morning.</p>

<p class="indent">Moses&#39; shirt went very well, for after it was cut
and basted, Grandmother offered to do all the necessary
finishing, but Madget&#39;s dress kept both the girls
busy almost all the rest of the day. It was a very
effective garment, despite the fact that the seams
were not finished. The hem was done beautifully
by hand, the little sleeves were lace trimmed, and
the pink chambray of which the dress was made hung
in graceful folds about the small figure. Madget&#39;s
toilet was very successful, but as for Mabel, ill luck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
seemed to blight her costume from the very start.
One side of the dress was cut shorter than the other,
both sleeves turned out to be for one arm, and there
was no more material to cut another, and to add
dismay to discomfiture, Elizabeth spilt a whole
bottle of ink over the front breadth just as she was
getting it ready for the machine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what we are going to do,&quot; Peggy
cried. &quot;It&#39;s nearly four o&#39;clock. We&#39;ve just about
got time to wash and dress them and get them
started.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother appeared at this juncture with a
little white, frilly garment in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s an apron that would just about fit the
oldest girl,&quot; she said. &quot;I know it ain&#39;t the style to
wear aprons, and this would cover all her new dress
up, but I found it, and I just thought I&#39;d show it to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth looked at it speculatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She could wear that for a dress,&quot; she cried. &quot;We
could just sew in lace at the armholes, and nobody
would ever know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I got to be washed?&quot; Moses demanded. &quot;I
can wash myself, and I will, too. Kin I borry
an old tablecloth or something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s a towel,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want an old tablecloth, <i>too</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come downstairs and I&#39;ll give you one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
Children takes notions,&quot; Grandmother said. &quot;He
probably has an idea of some kind. You come
along with me, Moses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus relieved of Moses, Peggy and Elizabeth
each took a little girl and scrubbed and polished and
combed till the result was miraculous. With the
wonderful, red curls smoothed and a big yellow bow
on top of them, Mabel looked like the distinctive
child she was meant to be. The apron proved a
great success.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She looks just as well as Madget, in spite of
all our trouble,&quot; Elizabeth said a little dolefully.
&quot;There&#39;s nothing to cry about in that, Madget.
You want your sister to look as well as you do, don&#39;t
you, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; Madget answered, concisely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s awfully cunning, if she is bad,&quot; Peggy
said, standing off to view the effect of her finishing
touches. &quot;She looks good enough to eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ice-cream and potato salud, and beans and coffee
an&#39; ice-cream,&quot; Madget began, at the suggestion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said <i>you</i> looked good enough to eat, Madget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>am</i> going to eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you suppose Moses is? It&#39;s time he
was dressing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he went downstairs with Grandma. There
he comes now, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trailing up the front stairs into the guest chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
which was the centre of activities, Moses appeared,
swaddled in the folds of a red damask tablecloth,
holding his clothes in his hand. His hair was dripping,
but from the rest of his person there emanated
an atmosphere, even an odour, of shining cleanliness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Want to know how I washed?&quot; he inquired,
proudly. &quot;I went out by the back door, and I took
off all my clothes, and then I rubbed myself all over
with yaller soap, and then I turned the hose on till
I come nice and clean. I don&#39;t like to take no baths
in the house. You can&#39;t get the water to squizzling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I guess it squizzled, all right,&quot; Peggy said.
&quot;Now get yourself into these clothes quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was two thoroughly exhausted girls that finally
marshalled their charges into the Town Hall, where
the bean supper was to take place, but they felt that
their efforts to improve the Steppe children were
justified by the result. Moses in a brown shirt,
bloomers and stockings to match them, with his
not unshapely feet encased in black sneakers, and a
red Windsor tie&mdash;he had demanded red&mdash;headed the
little procession. Then Mabel, proudly pinned into
her white apron, with a yellow sash about her middle,
and the lace frills of her improvised sleeves draped
elegantly about her elbows, and lastly the resplendent
Madget&mdash;a complete product in pink chambray and
ribbons to match.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Their colours all swear at each other,&quot; Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
said, &quot;I never thought of that, did you, Peggy?
We&#39;ll put Moses between. His tie doesn&#39;t go with
pink or yellow, but there isn&#39;t very much of it, thank
goodness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are the beans?&quot; Mabel asked, practically,
as they seated her at one end of a long, deal table
decorated with bunches of small American flags&mdash;the
occasion was patriotic&mdash;clustered in cups and
glasses, like stiff-stemmed flowers, and vases of
dahlias and asters and rambler roses flanking
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t show your ign&#39;rance,&quot; Moses said, witheringly.
&quot;It&#39;s a bean <i>supper</i>. You don&#39;t have no
more beans than you do supper. See the chocolate
cake, Madget, and the custid pie, and the potato
salud?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that yellar stuff, with leaves growing
out of it?&quot; Mabel inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s potato salud. Ain&#39;t you never seen
potato salud before? Where you been all your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To home,&quot; Mabel answered, literally.</p>

<p class="indent">Madget, elevated on a wooden box with Peggy&#39;s
coat thrown over it, sat speechless between her
brother and Elizabeth. The hall began to fill
rapidly. A young girl mounted the platform and
started a few uncertain notes on the wheezy organ.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s going to be the &#39;Star-Spangled Banner,&#39;
Peggy groaned. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get these children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
up again.&quot; But one of the bustling waitresses
hurried to the side of the young organist, and arrested
her in mid-career.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t play that,&quot; she was heard protesting.
&quot;We want to feed this lot, and get them out in time
to set the tables twice. We haven&#39;t got time for
them to stand up through the anthem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young musician switched obediently to &quot;I
am always blowing bubbles&mdash;blowing bubbles in the
air,&quot; which Moses sang with her nonchalantly.</p>

<p class="indent">Plates of cold ham and corned beef began to
circulate up and down the table. The portly waitresses,
family matrons in white duck and muslin,
enveloped in huge white aprons with long strings
tied imposingly behind, began to pass the beans, and
to distribute thick mugs of golden-brown coffee.</p>

<p class="indent">Madget still gazed ahead, with unseeing eyes and
quivering lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You eat your supper,&quot; Moses said, not unkindly,
&quot;or brother&#39;ll land you one when he gets you home.
Ain&#39;t you thankful for all that Miss Laury Ann and
Elizabeth and Peggy Farraday has done for you?
See me eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See me,&quot; Mabel contributed, encouragingly, but
Madget&#39;s miserable silence was unbroken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s not pay any attention to her,&quot; Peggy
whispered. &quot;She&#39;s got stage fright. I don&#39;t believe
she&#39;s ever been in a crowd before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
&quot;And such a crowd,&quot; Elizabeth groaned. &quot;Where
did they all come from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, from all around. These suppers are awfully
popular, because you are allowed to eat all you can
for thirty-five cents. All these women that have to
do their own cooking all the time are so glad to have a
meal that somebody else gets ready. Lots of poor
old hermits that live alone like to come and stuff
themselves in a civilized manner once in a while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Civilized!&quot; Elizabeth cried, looking down at the
three-pronged fork with which she had been vainly
trying to spear her beans. &quot;Sheets for tablecloths,
and paper napkins, and these implements of torture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Civilization, as my history teacher loves to remark,
is all a matter of comparison. Don&#39;t eat with
your knife, Moses, dear. Nice little boys don&#39;t eat
with their knives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moses looked around inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t got no spoon,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don&#39;t you try a fork?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t never et with a fork,&quot; he said. &quot;Forks is
for women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s about right,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Look down the
table, Elizabeth&mdash;Elspeth, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A long line of men and boys, with only an occasional
woman sandwiched in between, faced them.
They were all eating steadily and industriously with
their knives. At intervals they would stretch a far-reaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
hand for more supplies, or nudge a neighbour,
and indicate with a grunt a plate of food that
was out of their reach. Peggy began to choke with
suppressed merriment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look, look, there comes old Samuel Swift,&quot; she
said. &quot;Would you think they would let him in?
Oh, isn&#39;t he an outrageous old creature? Who is he,
anyway, Elspeth? Do you know? Where did he
come from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a sort of&mdash;of relation of mine,&quot; Elizabeth
said, bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cousin Samuel,&quot; Peggy cried. &quot;Do you think
we ought to invite him to come and sit beside us?
Oh, dear, I wish you&#39;d pinch me. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have
hysterics if I don&#39;t stop seeing the funny side of
everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m having&mdash;having trouble on my own account,&quot;
giggled Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s Madget?&quot; Peggy gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">Madget&#39;s empty seat confronted them accusingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She got bashful, and went under the table,&quot;
Mabel said. &quot;She has those bashful spells. I give
her a piece of bread and butter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget, secure from embarrassment in this seclusion,
ate everything that her thoughtful brother
and sister provided her with, impartially. Her pink
chambray suffered from contact with the dusty floor
and the butter and chocolate icing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
&quot;What&#39;s the odds, so long as she&#39;s happy?&quot; Peggy
cried. &quot;That&#39;s better than having her cry into her
plate. See Moses. Isn&#39;t he wonderful? I don&#39;t suppose
he ever really got enough to eat before in his life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose he is wonderful,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but I
wish he&#39;d keep his bloomers up, or else not get up
from the table when he passes food down to Madget.
You&#39;d think he&#39;d feel them slipping, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be all right if he had something on
under them,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t think of that, did you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve busted in my back,&quot; Mabel informed them,
cheerfully, &quot;I guess I&#39;ve et so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish we&#39;d sewed her in, instead of pinning her
in,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but never mind. I&#39;ll take my
school pin. She&#39;s lost one of the blue enamel baby
pins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a pin down my back,&quot; Mabel said,
wriggling. &quot;Shall I git it for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, not here, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d just as soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we wouldn&#39;t just as soon have you. After
the ice-cream comes, we&#39;ll go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But when this condition had been fulfilled, Madget
presented an unexpected obstacle to their departure.
She had her ice-cream in her hiding place, and
spilled a great deal of it down the front of her dress.
By some unique manipulation of her spoon she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
managed to smear her hair with it also. It was not
because of these casualties that she refused to make a
second public appearance, however. She merely
preferred not to see the light of day again, having
successfully sought sanctuary from an intimidating
multitude. Finally, Elizabeth picked her up, and
bore her kicking and screaming from the hall, Woodrow
Wilson, under the protection of his flag, looking
down at her with some criticism implied in his glance,
and the unfriendly crowd of Madget&#39;s imagination
seemed to be boring a hole in her back with its
composite gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a relief to get Moses out without his
trousers falling off,&quot; Peggy declared. &quot;Mabel&#39;s apron
was entirely undone, and her hair came down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think how well their shoes and stockings looked,&quot;
Elizabeth said, philosophically. &quot;I&#39;m glad we gave
them a treat, but I think I should have lived ten
years longer if the bean supper hadn&#39;t occurred.
Madget&#39;s got an awfully shrill voice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can hear her yet,&quot; Peggy laughed, &quot;&#39;I won&#39;t
come out. I won&#39;t go home. I won&#39;t stay here. I
won&#39;t be good.&#39; Honestly, Elspeth, it was screamingly
funny if we wanted to look at it that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we didn&#39;t do it to be funny,&quot; Elizabeth
wailed. &quot;We did it to be kind. Did you ever stop to
think, Peggy, how different things are in real life
from the way they are in books? In a book it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
have come out that the children&#39;s clothes were a great
success, and the children had a lovely time, and the
two young heroines were greatly admired for their
philanthropy. Or if it had been a funny book, the
children would have said funny things that you could
have enjoyed. In real life, you just get tired and hot,
and things seem flat and stupid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were walking home as they talked, with the
three children solemnly herded in front of them. The
arch of maple trees that shaded the main street of the
town swayed softly in the breeze. The birds were
still busy calling to each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know that life is so much different from
books,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;It sometimes seems to me
much more beautiful. You can&#39;t see the colour of
the trees in a book. Walking down Main Street
doesn&#39;t mean a thing if you read about it, but when
you are doing it, you can smell the flowers and hear
the birds sing and see the trees waving in the breeze.&quot;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I hear the wind among the trees</span>
<span class="i0">Playing celestial symphonies.</span>
<span class="i0">I see their branches downward bent,</span>
<span class="i0">Like keys of some great instrument,&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth quoted. &quot;They do look a little like a great
harp, don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say that they do,&quot; Peggy returned, candidly,
&quot;but they sound like one. You know a lot of
poetry, don&#39;t you, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
&quot;I&#39;d like to know a lot of poetry. My friend Jean
Forsyth knows almost all the poetry that was ever
written. She is really literary, you know. I think
she&#39;ll be a great poetess when she grows up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to meet her some time,&quot; Peggy said.
&quot;Oh, listen to Moses.&quot; She beckoned Elizabeth
nearer the children, who were engaged in animated
discussion of the afternoon&#39;s festivities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could go back there and eat a whole pot o&#39; beans
and a plate o&#39; corn beef, and a freezer of ice-cream,
and a six-quart measure of coffee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you go back then?&quot; the practical
Mabel inquired, &quot;it was paid for you to eat all you
wanted to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did eat all I wanted to. I was only saying how
much more I could eat <i>if</i> I wanted to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>did</i> eat a freezer of ice-cream, didn&#39;t I, Mabel?&quot;
Madget insisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t have no freezer of ice-cream to eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did so. A big bear crawled under the table, and
gave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mabel lifted a sisterly hand to chastise her for the
sin of prevarication, but Elizabeth arrested the blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madget knows she didn&#39;t see a big bear. She is
only having her little joke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A dancing bear, with a great big little monkey on
its back,&quot; Madget offered in corroboration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like jokes,&quot; Mabel said. &quot;I ain&#39;t agoing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
have her make &#39;em. I&#39;d rather talk about what I had
to eat, and I can&#39;t if Moses and the baby won&#39;t give
me any chance to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what you do,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;you
run home and tell your marmer and your parper all
about it. The one that gets there first can talk the
most, you know. Now we&#39;ll go and tell Grandmummy,&quot;
she added, as the children took to their
heels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what she&#39;ll say,&quot; Elizabeth mused.
&quot;She always says something that you don&#39;t quite
expect, but that somehow settles things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What she did say, after listening to the complete
recital of the affair with an almost suspiciously long
face, was merely:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a great satisfaction in undertaking a
thing and going straight through to the end, no
matter how it comes out. What&#39;s worth doing is
worth doing well, and I was real proud of the way
you two girls stuck it out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that&#39;s something,&quot; Peggy said to Elizabeth,
&quot;but deep down in the bottom of her soul, she&#39;s
laughing at us, just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s laughing at us&mdash;some,&quot; Elizabeth acknowledged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">The Locked Closet</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sister Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Your epistles of late show a great improvement. I don&#39;t
refer to the spelling and rhetoric. You are not one of these fancy
spellers, I am thankful to state, and you subject the English
language to only an average amount of ill treatment. What I
am referring to is your morale. Your morale has certainly looked
up. Your letters from the farm leave nothing to be desired,
though they create an atmosphere of yearning for the farm, and
all the livestock inclusively. This is a flattering statement.
Being weakened by long suffering, I don&#39;t mind admitting right
out in writing that I&#39;d rather see my sister than even Old Dog
Tray.</p>

<p class="indent">It&#39;s good of you to return this compliment. You did in your
last letter, you know, but I&#39;m afraid, if you once got me down
there, you would repent of your bargain. Even sisters have
their limits, and, to tell you the secret that is preying on my
damask cheek (See Bartlett&#39;s Familiar Quotations)&mdash;like the
worm in the well-known bud&mdash;no girl but you cares a tinker&#39;s
damn what becomes of me. No girl but you answers my letters.
To be sure, you are the only girl I write to, but I don&#39;t think that
ought to make a real difference, do you? You&#39;d write your
Buddy&mdash;if he was your Buddy&mdash;no matter what stood in the
way, wouldn&#39;t you? If he wasn&#39;t your Buddy, you wouldn&#39;t.
<i>Voil l&#39;obstacle.</i> That&#39;s Sarah Bernhardt for &quot;Aye, there&#39;s the
rub,&quot; if anybody should ask you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
All of which is complete nonsense. The general idea is that
I am not getting well very fast, and I don&#39;t care very much if I
am not. France was France, and I made it&mdash;Dieu merci! If
I never make anything else, I hope I shan&#39;t do much hollering,
but I, too, was young once, little sister. So whenever you feel it&#39;s
a hardship to milk six cows before sunrise&mdash;as I suppose of course
you are doing&mdash;give a thought to your bed-ridden</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Buddy.</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Buddy</span>, my own darling, dear, dear <span class="smcap">Buddy</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I love you best, best, best, which doesn&#39;t include the other
generation, on account of its being so unflattering to our mutual
mother and father, but is almost completely true, all the same.
I hate to love anybody so much, because there is a hurt in loving
all that. My hurt is in your not getting better, and not feeling
more encouraged about it. Mother writes that your discouragement
is worse than your sickness. Oh, dear, Buddy, don&#39;t be
discouraged. Please, please, please don&#39;t. You <i>did</i> go over to
France and fight. You did get a D. S. C. that all your family
are so proud of, their hats will hardly fit any more. You are
perfectly lovely yourself, and better looking than any one, and
have perfectly fascinating manners. Isn&#39;t that something?
Any girl would be crazy about you, and if there is any girl you
want to be crazy about you, I&#39;ll bet you could get her without
half trying. I know that if you only wanted to be a girl&#39;s friend,
you would be a perfectly beautiful, tranquil friend to her, and she
would like it better to have you be that than to have a lover of
any kind. Also I believe that if ever you wanted to get engaged
just by letter, you could do that, too.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy Farraday&#39;s sister Ruth is expected down here any time.
I believe that she is the girl you used to correspond with before
you went to France. Perhaps you have forgotten all about her
by this time. Peggy and I took the Steppe children to a bean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
supper. I will describe this at length anon. It made them
quite sick. As I remarked before, I like you better than ice-cream
or pink silk underclothing.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Elspeth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Elspeth waited anxiously for the answer to this
letter, for she had tried to be very tactful and helpful,
and to handle strategically the secret that she had
surprised, but Buddy&#39;s answer was a blow. He
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sis</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;m duly appreciative of the soft stuff. I sure do appreciate
your letters, and I know you like the way I look. (We might
be mistaken for twins, save for the slight accident of a few years&#39;
handicap.) But I&#39;d be willing to can that Everywoman stuff,
if it&#39;s all the same to you. Don&#39;t go getting ideas in your head
about the girls I&#39;m clubby with. My first letter was all a joke,
and I gave you the credit for understanding a joke. That&#39;s all.
Keep on the subject of the old farm, and this year&#39;s crop of brass
tacks, and you will suit me fine.</p>

<p class="indent">I am no better, but a lot worse. Don&#39;t, however, mention me
to any one but Grandpa and G-ma. If any one wants to know
how I am, say that I am aces up, and anxious to get discharged
and go to Russia. Yes, if I can get my old job back, I might
get a chance at Russia, and that&#39;s what I want. To get as far
out of this country as I can get. If this letter sounds grouchy&mdash;it&#39;s
because I am grouchy, and not that I don&#39;t like my relations.
I do, and here&#39;s a kiss to prove it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bud.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see why a tactful letter like mine made
him sore,&quot; Elizabeth thought, forlornly, and inelegantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
But a communication from her mother,
a day or two later, made her understand her brothers
state of mind and body a little more clearly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Be careful how and what you write to Junior&mdash;John, I mean.
He is in a highly excitable condition, and little things worry him
out of all proportion. Recently his great fear seems to be that
you will gossip about his condition to friends of his that you may
meet on the Cape. As far as I can find out, he has no friends
there except his immediate family, but he says that you don&#39;t
understand how a fellow hates to have his physical condition
discussed, and he seems to be in terror lest you tell someone
whom he doesn&#39;t care to have informed just what a state he is in.
I am writing you this for two reasons: First, I don&#39;t want you
to mind if John writes you irritably, and second, I promised him
that I would ask you not to talk about him to any one at all.</p>

<p class="indent">Your father and I are as comfortable as we can be with this
anxiety upon our minds, but New York is very uncomfortable
just at present, and keeping cool is an occupation in itself. I
miss my little girl. I didn&#39;t realize, Elizabeth, dear, how many
things you do for me, how many steps you save me, and how
many thoughtful little things you contribute to my comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">I know it is hard for you to be away from us, but I am so thankful
for your brave and helpful spirit and the real character building
that I feel you are accomplishing. Every letter I get I am
prouder of, and so is your father. You could make it so much
harder for us if you were not trying to get through the summer
right.</p>

<p class="indent">Do be careful when you go into the water, and don&#39;t ever
stay in too long. Take plenty of wraps to the beach to put on
when you come out. Don&#39;t let Grandmother feed you too many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
pies and cakes, but obey and trust her in every other way. She
is a very wise woman. Mother knows in just what ways this
summer is hard for you, and she loves you dearly&mdash;dearly.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mother.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I had got all over the habit of crying
at Mothers letters, but it seems that I haven&#39;t,&quot;
Elizabeth said. &quot;I know what Buddy&#39;s afraid of
now. I shall just have to use my own judgment and
try to make it the best old judgment I ever used in
my life.&quot; She wrote again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Buddy</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I am very snubbed, but I guess I shall survive. I will can
the Everywoman stuff, but after all, I know more about it than
you do, even at my very immature age, because some day I am
going to grow up to be a woman, and in spite of your very great
and boasted superiority&mdash;<i>you</i> aren&#39;t.</p>

<p class="indent">I won&#39;t talk about you to any one except to G-pa and G-ma,
and not them if you don&#39;t want me to. But I shall say that I
love you, and why. You&#39;re a dear darling, that&#39;s why, and if
I was cross a little bit at your letter, I got right over it, on account
of your being such a dear, <i>and</i> such a darling.</p>

<p class="indent">I am glad you can sit up some. I ate a whole pint of ice-cream
and a quarter of a chocolate cake to-day, and thought of our
childhood days when you did the same thing. Peggy Farraday&#39;s
sister came yesterday, and I think she is a peacherine. She inquired
for you and I said you were getting better, and thanked
her. Buddy, I won&#39;t say nothing to nobody that will make you
out an invalid or not an invalid. When asked, I shall open my
mouth wide, and say nothing, nothing, nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">I do, I do, I do love you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Elspeth.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
The answer to this was brief:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sis</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Consider yourself patted on the back, and congratulated for
being the nicest girl. Enclosed find two dollars which will
buy six or eight pints of vanilla girl-exterminator, and don&#39;t,
after taking the dose, leave a letter telling how you met your fate.</p>

<p class="right">Yours,
The mean old Grouch, <span class="smcap">Bud</span>.</p>

<p >P. S. Tell Peggy Farraday&#39;s sister anything you please.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It was not long after this exchange of letters
that Elizabeth asked her grandmother for the key
of the locked closet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you had forgot all about it,&quot; her grandmother
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I was rash enough to promise Peggy
that she could be with me when I opened it, and we&#39;ve
been doing so many things out of doors together that
we haven&#39;t had any other time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, here it is. You can play with anything
you find, as long as you want to, but hang the clothes
up again, come night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will, Grandmother. I&#39;m so excited, and I&#39;ve
got to go upstairs and twirl my thumbs until Peggy
comes. Send her right up, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting upstairs in her little blue room, Elizabeth
began reading over her brother&#39;s letters, and pondering
on his sudden change of mood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;When he heard that Ruth Farraday was coming
down here he was afraid I would say something to her.
Before he knew that, he was willing to be just as
mushy as I was. I suppose being in love is a pretty
terrible feeling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Elizabeth-Elspeth,&quot; sang Peggy from the
bottom of the stairs, &quot;can I bring my sister Ruth
up with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cert-certainly.&quot; Elizabeth flew to straighten
the pillows on the cradle settee, and to pick up some
stray threads from the braided rug in front of it. &quot;I
shall be very glad to see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Farraday, in a rose-and-white striped satin
sports skirt, with a fleecy, rose-coloured sweater
and hat to match, made a very pretty picture against
the background of Elizabeth&#39;s little room. &quot;Like
a rose against the blue of the sky,&quot; Elizabeth thought.
&quot;Her name ought to be Rose, anyway. How becoming
she would be to Buddy&#39;s dark eyes and colouring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the room, Ruth,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;you can
look at it for two minutes, and then you&#39;ve got to
stop looking at it, because we are gathered together
to-day for quite another purpose, to wit, to penetrate
the mysteries of Blue Beard&#39;s closet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a lovely room,&quot; Ruth said, smiling. &quot;I
wouldn&#39;t have intruded on this very special occasion,
except that it began to rain as I was bidding Peggy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
good-bye at the gate, and Peggy thought you would
rather shelter me than have me run away through
the flood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;and it will be fun
to have you see what&#39;s in the closet if you don&#39;t
mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall adore it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I adore you,&quot; Elizabeth said to herself, &quot;already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;d better hurry,&quot; Peggy cried. &quot;Ruth is getting
ready to rave about the cradle settee and the
flag-bottomed chairs. If we get started telling her the
history of all the things in the room, we shan&#39;t get a
look at Blue Beard&#39;s wives. Ruthie, dear, this is the
key to the enchanted closet. Doesn&#39;t it look spooky?
This house is a hundred and twenty-five years old,
and see, all the doors have latches instead of knobs.
Which leads us to this one particular door.&quot; Peggy
linked an arm through that of her sister on one side
and her friend on the other, &quot;And presto! Here we
are. Now, Elizabeth-Elspeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One, two, three!&quot; Elizabeth turned the big key
in the ponderous lock, and the door swung wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blue Beard&#39;s wives&#39; trousseaux!&quot; Peggy said.
&quot;One hundred and one thousand two hundred and
forty-three silk dresses of the Georgian period. I
don&#39;t know when the Georgian period was, but I
guess this is it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth stepped inside the closet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
&quot;These things run from about eighteen fifty to
the early nineties; mostly Victorian, if you must be
educated, Peggy,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I must, but look, look, look, at all these
beauties.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On rows of little pegs driven into the low rafters
of the irregular triangle that formed the closet were
the carefully preserved relics of three generations
of dainty feminine finery. Dresses of taffeta and
dimity and poplin, in all the flower-like gradations
of colour that our grandmothers remember their
mothers and grandmothers looking most distinguished
in. Not only gowns, but capes and dolmans
and dressing sacques, and, packed away in a barricade
of old-fashioned, flowered bandboxes, were
the bonnets and hats, and even some of the gay
little bags and muffs that complemented the costumes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never saw anything so wonderful in my life,&quot;
Ruth Farraday said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, let&#39;s try them on. Let&#39;s get Grandmummy
to tell us about them. Let&#39;s dress Ruth up and take
a snapshot of her. Let&#39;s&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Peggy&#39;s breath failed
her.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 469px;">

<img class="border" src="images/illus109.jpg" width="469" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;Oh! let&#39;s try them on&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s Grandmother now,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother, making her placid way through the
outer chamber, smiled, and held out her hand to
Ruth Farraday.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Peggy&#39;s sister,&quot; she said, &quot;well, well, it&#39;s good
to have Peggy bring her sister along&mdash;to play in the
garret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This&mdash;this is Miss Farraday, Grandmother,&quot;
Elizabeth said. &quot;She&mdash;she isn&#39;t&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth is trying to say that I am not a little
girl, but I&#39;m not really so very far from it. I&#39;m not
so grown up that I want to be sent out of the attic
now I&#39;ve just seen all these lovely things. You
don&#39;t mind if I stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d mind if you didn&#39;t stay. You are the kind
o&#39; sight that sore eyes is aching for all the world over.&quot;
The old woman and the girl smiled at each other as
if they had been friends all their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First, tell me who this belonged to, Grandmummy,&quot; Peggy
dragged at her sleeve imploringly,
&quot;and then tell me who every single dress here belonged
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they belonged to a number of people,
all told. Some of my wedding things is there. That
rose lavender silk in your hand, Peggy, was the dress
I appeared out to meeting in the Sunday after I was
married. The blue silk with the black velvet ribbon
scallops around the basque was the dress my sister
Alviry wore to my wedding. She had long, pink
ribbon streamers on her hat, a chip hat trimmed
with pink roses, and she was a picture, I can tell you.
My appearing-out hat is here somewhere&mdash;like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
Alviry&#39;s, only trimmed with little lavender plumes.
I had a black silk trimmed with jet. That&#39;s it, that
Elizabeth has her hand on. That&#39;s too old for me
yet, but everybody had to have a black silk dress
that was heavy enough to stand alone in those
days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s this little love of a pink muslin with all
these tiny, tiny ruffles on it, Grandmother dear?
See these bell-shaped white undersleeves, and this
figured pink sash, Peggy. Wouldn&#39;t your sister
look a dream in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was the dress I wore when I give your grandfather
my promise. I liked it better than any dress
I ever had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think you would have,&quot; Peggy put in,
fervently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have liked it best if your grandfather
had never been born in the world. Leastways,
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always said. It was the first dress
my mother ever let me have all the say about.
Dresses had to be chose for their wearing qualities
when I was a girl. If they wouldn&#39;t wash and turn,
year out and year in, we warn&#39;t allowed to have &#39;em,
but I had set my heart on a pink muslin with dolman
undersleeves, and after I went and nursed Grandmother
White through scarlet fever, and just barely
lived after I caught it myself, Mother said I could
have anything I wanted as a present to get well on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
Land, I begun to improve from the day that dress
was promised me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think you would have,&quot; Peggy said,
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was pretty brave of you to go into a house
where they had scarlet fever, and nurse your grandmother
through it,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Weren&#39;t you
deadly afraid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t remember much about that part. My
father sent me, and so I went, but I shall never forget
the day when I first put on the dress. Your grandfather
he was calling on my brother Jonas when I
come down the stairs drawing my train after me.
Jonas he started to stare at me, and then he began to
say poetry. An old poem he used to say whenever
he wanted to tease me:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Here she goes, there she goes,</span>
<span class="i0">All dressed up in her Sunday clothes,</span>
<span class="i0">High-heeled boots and a cashmere shawl,</span>
<span class="i0">Grecian bend and a waterfall.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I was so put out, I run upstairs and didn&#39;t come
down again till he coaxed me down with the promise
of a drive to Bass River by moonlight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how about Grandfather? You said that
was the very dress he proposed to you in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So t&#39;was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he propose that evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;No, he didn&#39;t. I was so put out at Jonas that I
wouldn&#39;t have a word to say to your grandpa for a
whole week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was hard on Grandfather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He went and got another girl and took her to the
Harvest Dance. Eliza Perkins, and she wore a
mahogany-coloured silk that made her look as
sallow as a pumpkin. I was so sorry for him that
I kinder made it up to him. I suppose girls will always
be high and mighty with the boys they like
best. I never took the trouble to plague any other
of the young men, but your grandfather I used to make
life a burden to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nowadays it&#39;s the young men that are high and
mighty,&quot; Ruth Farraday said, &quot;they go into the
service, and their uniforms turn their heads, and
then they&mdash;forget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess the young men to-day ain&#39;t so different
from the men in my time, if you come right down to
it. I guess liking is liking&mdash;just the same as it always
was. Love will go where it&#39;s sent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you believe it comes once to every man, as
the saying goes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it. There&#39;s a lot of talk about loving
this one and that one, but when you get right down
to it, the second time is a pretty poor imitation of
the first. There is natures that&#39;s different, of course,
but true natures find their own and cling to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know that I like that for a philosophy,&quot;
Ruth said, &quot;it&#39;s all right&mdash;if it isn&#39;t one-sided,
but if only one feels it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ain&#39;t so often one-sided as you think&mdash;the
real thing ain&#39;t. If it ain&#39;t real&mdash;why, that&#39;s another
story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how is anybody going to tell if it is real?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ain&#39;t really any way of not telling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandmummy,&quot; Peggy begged, &quot;can we dress
Ruth up in your pink muslin and take a snapshot
of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certain, but you ought to curl her hair. I made
a hundred and twenty curls when I wore that dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s where Elizabeth inherits her curly locks.
Please dress up in Grandmother&#39;s muslin, Ruth.
Don&#39;t you want her to, Grandmummy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would do my heart good to see her pretty face
shining out over my pink muslin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you feel like that, then you shall,&quot; Ruth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a kind o&#39; feeling that it will bring you
luck,&quot; Grandmother said, when the soft hair had been
loosened and curled about the face, and the pink
muslin had been hooked and buttoned and tied till
it undulated in delicate folds and curves all about the
girl&#39;s slender body.</p>

<p class="indent">On the lawn under the honeysuckle arbour, on the
gate post, on the front steps of the old house, which
followed the old-time habit of facing the south,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
though the street was due north, Peggy took picture
after picture, and Ruth Farraday smiled up at the
sun like an old-fashioned blush rose blooming in an
old-time garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There comes Father,&quot; Grandmother said, &quot;let&#39;s
see how much he&#39;ll notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather, approaching, took in the tableau
under the honeysuckles. Elizabeth and Peggy
watched breathlessly as he made straight for the
little figure in Grandmothers pink muslin gown and
stood staring down at it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know who you be,&quot; he said, slowly, &quot;nor
where you got the dress you&#39;re wearing, but I know
what you make me feel like.&quot; He swept his hat to
his breast with a courtly, old-time bow, and bent over
Ruth&#39;s little hand and saluted it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he put out his other hand to his wife and
drew her arm within his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother,&quot; he said, softly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Letters and the Post Office</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeanie Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Your letter was lovely. I forget what you are like between
times a little, and then I look at your picture or get a letter from
you, and know. I can hardly believe you love me, after all you
know about me, but I guess you do. I wish I could see you, but
I am glad you are at the Point again this summer. I tried out
Mother about my coming to visit you, without asking in so
many words, but her idea is that she would like to have me stay
put. My brother may get well enough to come down here at
any time, and when he does I want to be chief nurse and bottle
washer&mdash;medicine bottles.</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;ve been doing quite a lot of things. I spend a great deal of
time with Peggy Farraday. She is very nice. Nicer than I am,
but not as nice as you, Jeanne of Arc. She is as nice as a Peggy
Farraday can be. She has a sister Ruth, who is as sweet as
peaches. She is about nineteen and a half, and blonde, with big
blue eyes and long golden lashes, and one of those soft voices
low in the throat, with a kind of thrill in it. You know&mdash;like
contralto singing. You would love her. I am wild about her,
and Buddy knows her. Don&#39;t mention that to any one. It&#39;s a
secret. If you were here I think I could hint to you some things
about it, but I can&#39;t on paper. Somebody might read a letter
some time that you didn&#39;t expect. Buddy is very unhappy,
and writes me one cross letter to every pleasant one. He is
afraid I shall not be discreet, but discreet is my middle name, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
use slang. Oh, I long to tell you what I mean. He won&#39;t write
to her and she won&#39;t to him, and I am trying to make them. You
can see how exciting it is.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I must give you a brief rsum of what I have been doing,
before I close. Monday we went in swimming, and afterwards,
in the Farraday car, to Wianno, which is a very attractive summer
colony farther up the Cape. We stopped at Hyannis and
had ice-cream with a frozen pudding sauce. Tuesday, after
swimming, Grandfather took us to Chatham in the noble Ford&mdash;me
and Peggy&mdash;and we stopped at an attractive little tea room,
where we had chocolate ice-cream. Wednesday we went swimming
and then we walked to the adjoining town where we got
some wonderful ice-cream sodas, three apiece. Peggy and I
have each got over thirty Negroes. I told you how we were
counting them in order to find out our fate. I am glad you
have begun, too. I love you dearly.</p>

<p class="right">Your own <span class="smcap">Elizabeth-Elspeth</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">(Peggy calls me that. She sends her love even though she doesn&#39;t
know you.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth was in a letter-writing mood, and sealing
Jean&#39;s letter with her favourite sky-blue sealing wax,
stamped with her monogram signet ring, she opened
her letter-case again. She began:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Daddy</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">We don&#39;t write very many letters to each other this summer.
At least, I don&#39;t write many separate ones to you, but all the
letters that go to Mother are meant for you, too. My special
particular efforts go to Buddy. Poor Buddy! I hope you will
soon be able to bring him to his own grandmother&#39;s hunting
ground. He keeps writing me about going to Russia. I guess
I should want to go to Russia if my health was as discouraging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
as Buddy&#39;s. I worry about him, and, Daddy, dear, I worry about
you. I have made the great discovery that a Daddy is a Daddy,
and that it has to work pretty hard buying wardrobe trunks and
Japanese kimonas and almond nut bars for its female offspring.</p>

<p class="indent">When I think of you sweltering in that hot city whether you
want to or not, I get quite upset. You have to work every day,
don&#39;t you, whether you feel like it or not? I never thought of
that before till last evening, and it made me a little bit ill, it
struck me with such force. I have just never happened to
think of it in that light. I can tell you, Daddy, it made me love
you harder than ever, and that&#39;s pretty hard. Well, all I can
say is that I respect you more than anybody, and I hope you are
never sorry you got married and got this family on your hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Now for a few words to cheer you up. Monday we went in
swimming, Peggy and I, and afterwards in the Farraday car to
Wianno. I guess you know all about Wianno. We stopped
at Hyannis and had some ice-cream with frozen pudding sauce.
Tuesday we swam and Grandfather took us to Chatham in the
Grand Old Ford, and we had chocolate ice-cream there. Wednesday
we went in swimming and then walked to Harwich and
got three ice-cream sodas. Also we counted quite a lot of Negroes.
I wrote Mother that we had to get ninety-nine Negroes etc. for
a stunt we are doing. Portuguese count, if they are dark enough.</p>

<p class="indent">I love you more than my old scratchy pen can tell. There
goes the station barge, with the morning mail. So here goes I
after it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Your Baby</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"You write an awful lot of letters, Elizabeth,&quot; said
Peggy, as the two met at the post-office steps. &quot;You
get a lot, too. I&#39;m not much good at correspondence.
Did you ever write to a boy, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;No, not really. Only thank-you letters and
answering invitations and things like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t you ever tell, Elizabeth, because I
might get teased, but I&#39;m writing to a boy right now.
That is, I am going to be when I&#39;ve answered his
letter. It isn&#39;t a silly boy, though, it&#39;s a sensible
boy&mdash;a boy that knows a lot of things I want to learn
about. Chester Reynolds, you know, that I&#39;ve told
you about winning the tennis cups. I got a letter
from him last night. It isn&#39;t supposed to be very nice
to show letters, but if you&#39;d like to see this one,
I&#39;ll bring it around to-morrow, and then I&#39;ll bring my
answer to it, and let you see what you think of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Elizabeth agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it a funny thing, he is the only boy that I
ever thought I&#39;d like to correspond with, and now he
has just sat himself down and written to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that&#39;s very nice.&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;There&#39;s a boy in New York that I felt that same
way about. He sort of offered to send me a copy of
&#39;Prometheus Bound,&#39; but I knew if he did that I
should have to write and thank him, and I didn&#39;t
know whether Mother would approve of my writing
him like that when I was away from home, so I didn&#39;t
say anything more about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is &#39;Prometheus Bound,&#39; anyway?&quot; Peggy
inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I think it is a kind of a blank verse poem or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
book, something like Whittier&#39;s &#39;Snow Bound,&#39; but
I&#39;m not sure. That was one reason that I wanted
him to send it&mdash;so I could find out. He was quite a
literary boy, one of Jeanie&#39;s friends. He&#39;s very good
looking, though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like literary boys as a rule, though, do
you?&quot; Peggy asked. &quot;They usually wear rubbers
and horn rims, and have to mind their mothers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not any friend of Jeanie&#39;s. Her friends are
always all-around boys. They must have brains, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; Peggy said, impressed.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd on the post-office steps was beginning
to thicken. The big bags, bulging with mail, had
been passed behind the glass faade of the mail-box
section, and behind the closed wicket that indicated
the distribution was taking place the silent postmaster
and his assistant worked with grim, accustomed
rapidity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s go and watch them put the things into the
boxes,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;It&#39;s the most exciting thing
to see the letters go in. Ours is 178. See, here it is,&quot;
she cried, as Peggy followed her into the stuffy office.
&quot;There&#39;s a card from Buddy already, and one for
Grandfather from the Bass River Savings Bank, and
one fat one that I can&#39;t see the face of that I hope is
from Jean. She doesn&#39;t always wait to get answers,
you know. She writes when the spirit moves and so
do I. I&#39;ve just been writing her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
&quot;When you go back to New York, let&#39;s write to
each&mdash;I mean one another&mdash;like that, only I&#39;m afraid
you&#39;ll get the worst of the bargain. When the spirit
moves me to write a letter, it mostly only moves me
to say, &#39;Dear Elspeth,&#39; or whoever it is, &#39;Hello!
Yours frantically fondly, Peggy.&#39; It&#39;s funny, when
I like to talk so much, that I don&#39;t like to write more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s my thirty-first,&quot; Elizabeth whispered,
as a solemn black chauffeur made his appearance in
the post office.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My thirty-third,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;and outside is a
white horse. What a pity we have got to get the
white horses in sequence. They are so hard to find,
especially when you are looking for them. But
when we do get them all, I am going to keep my
hands behind me all the time, until I find somebody
I am willing to shake hands with!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be awful, after all this trouble, if we
didn&#39;t shake hands with the right one, wouldn&#39;t it,
Peggy? There goes a postcard right into my box.
It&#39;s for Judidy. She has a young man. Did you
know it? He&#39;s almost as fat as she is, and not nearly
so good looking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope she gets somebody very nice, and marries
them, and has a whole backyard full of fat pink
babies, though I don&#39;t know what Grandmummy
would do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandfather says she&#39;d get the work done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
quicker if she didn&#39;t have Judidy to look out for, and
I think perhaps she would. Isn&#39;t it funny, when I
first came, Judidy just seemed to me like a kind of
queer person that I felt not quite right about eating
at the table with, and now she&#39;s my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gate in the wicket flew up, and in an instant
it was surrounded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See all the mail-hungry fiends,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Oh,
goody, Mother&#39;s got a letter from my cousin in
Rome&mdash;and Ruth has a letter from that Chambers
fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What Chambers fellow?&quot; Elizabeth asked,
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Piggy Chambers I call him. He&#39;s got loads of
money and he is very good looking, and he just
pesters Ruthie to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She lets him. She likes it, rather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry. She&#39;s my sister.
Piggy Chambers isn&#39;t so bad. He&#39;s just kind of a
bore, you know, and awfully fond of writing letters
to Piggy Chambers, Esquire. Lots of grown-up
fellows are like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s your sister, but I love her, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shouldn&#39;t think much of you if you didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were on their way home by this time, and
the post-office crowd had begun to melt away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
streaming up and down the street, and into all the
cross roads.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish my grandmother would let me come
after the mail at night,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I have
to wait till Judidy or Zeke are ready to come,
or Grandfather will take me. As if I wasn&#39;t old
enough to go out after six o&#39;clock alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t your being old enough, it&#39;s the general
reputation of the post office being a place where the
crowd goes in the evening to&mdash;start something. You
know yourself that lots of things that go on there
don&#39;t look very well. It&#39;s such a mixed crowd, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As long as you behave yourself, I don&#39;t see what
difference it makes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve thought a lot about going to the post office
at night,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;and I&#39;ve argued a lot about
it with Ruthie and Mother, and the conclusion that
I&#39;ve come to is that it&#39;s just as well to keep away.
All the girls that aren&#39;t nice hang around there.
Some of the girls that are nice stay away. When I
grow up, my niceness is going to be so much a matter
of course that I won&#39;t have to look out for it so hard.
Just now I am going to obey Grandmummy&#39;s rule
to &#39;avoid the appearance of evil&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you are just about right, Peggy,&quot; Elizabeth
said after reflection. &quot;Sometimes you talk a
lot like Jeanie. Would you like to hear some of her
letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
&quot;I should say I would, but don&#39;t read it to me unless
you really want to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;and the reason I do is
that I think you are like Jean in some ways. You
are both of you way beyond me in the way you look
at things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The way I look at things is better than the way
I act sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m inclined to be just the other way around.
The way I look at things is worse than the way I act
most generally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m disobedient,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;and sloppy
weather, and always late to places. I do as I&#39;m told
about things like going to the post office at night,
but not about trying to run the car or getting home
on time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m just the other way,&quot; Elizabeth reflected.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t monkey with anything I was told not to
touch, but I&#39;d make a big fuss, if only in my own
mind, about obeying a grown-up rule that I didn&#39;t
understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Either way gets you into trouble at times,&quot; Peggy
said, sagely. &quot;Don&#39;t look round, but there are two
boys trailing behind us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of boys?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two of the boys that were down at the Aviation
Camp all last summer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they all right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
&quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t know them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are speaking to us. Don&#39;t look round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Oh, girls!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose they&#39;ll get tired and go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t look round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Oh, girls!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, look here,&quot; Peggy suddenly wheeled on the
two followers. &quot;We haven&#39;t met you. We&#39;re not
going to have you trailing around after us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The older of the two boys whipped off his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said, colouring. &quot;We
were only joking. We&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It puts us in an embarrassing position,&quot; Elizabeth
contributed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, some of the girls, they&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&quot; the other
boy also found explanation more difficult than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a difference in girls,&quot; Peggy said, severely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were only going to ask you the way to the
beach.&quot; The first boy&#39;s hair was a blazing, splendid
red. Elizabeth liked red-headed boys.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve seen you there almost every day this summer,&quot;
Peggy challenged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&#39;ve I seen you.&quot; The second boy had a wide,
ingratiating grin. &quot;We want to get acquainted,
that&#39;s all,&quot; he admitted, &quot;so we were pursuing what
seems to be the usual way down here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;That isn&#39;t the way to get acquainted with us,&quot;
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the way, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t ask <i>us</i>.&quot; Peggy gathered Elizabeth&#39;s arm
under hers, and hurried her along.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are sort of nice,&quot; she admitted, when they
had put several yards between them and the objects
of their encounter. &quot;If they are really nice, I suppose
they will get introduced the way they ought to.
If they aren&#39;t, well, we won&#39;t see them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a sort of strain waiting to find out such
things,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read me Jean&#39;s letter, and that will take our
minds off them,&quot; Peggy demanded, practically.
&quot;One reason that I don&#39;t like to have much to do with
boys is that when you get thinking about them it&#39;s
hard to get your mind on other things. If they are
silly, they aren&#39;t any fun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the other hand,&quot; Elizabeth argued, &quot;if they
aren&#39;t just a little bit&mdash;silly or&mdash;something&mdash;they
aren&#39;t so much fun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they have to be interested in you some,&quot;
Peggy admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I&#39;ll read you Jean&#39;s letter. We&#39;ll sit down
under this tree by the gate. See how pretty her
handwriting is. Doesn&#39;t she make fascinating E&#39;s
and R&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think there is a lot of character in handwriting,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
Peggy said, bending her head over the letter. &quot;See
this one from Piggy Chambers. He writes like a
pig and he is one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See this card from my brother Buddy. He writes
like a perfect gentleman, and he is one, though I say
it as shouldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve seen your brother&#39;s handwriting before,
but not for a long time. Why don&#39;t you write him
to write Ruthie? I&#39;d a whole lot rather she was hearing
from him regularly than from Piggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she a friendship with Mr.&mdash;Mr. Piggy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she hasn&#39;t. He just wants her to marry
him, and that&#39;s all there is about it. If your
brother is her friend, it would be the part of a good
friend to stick around just now, if only by correspondence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are things about my brother that you
don&#39;t understand, Peggy,&quot; Elizabeth said, solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thirty-four,&quot; Peggy said, her gaze diverted to
the street, &quot;count that one, Elizabeth. It may be
that same chauffeur, but never mind. We don&#39;t
know positively that it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now for Jean,&quot; Elizabeth said, after these
formalities were finished.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Elspeth-Elizabeth dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I&#39;ve had your long letter, the one that told about the Steppe
children (and how I laughed!), for a week, and your two postcards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
I wrote you one serious letter in answer to a serious one
from you, and now I&#39;ll just tell you about the way things are
going here. It&#39;s just the same thing&mdash;sailing, teas, dances,
bathing, and then begin all over and do it again. I like it all&mdash;especially
the sailing&mdash;&quot;a wet sheet and a flowing sea,&quot; you know,
is one of my ideals. Another ideal is getting realized, too. I&#39;m
learning to drive the car. I bogged it yesterday, and a farmer
with whiskers to his knees, and a long rope, like the funny papers,
came and pulled us out. The chauffeur was with me. He ought
to have prevented it, but he said I was too quick for him. Anyhow,
won&#39;t it be wonderful when I learn? Then you and I can
&quot;ride together, forever ride,&quot; as Browning says.</p>

<p class="indent">I went into New York on Thursday, and what do you think,
I went to see your brother Buddy. I called up your mother
from the station and she suggested it, so I did, as we had the car
and were going out of New York from his end of the town, anyway.
I felt two ways about doing so. One way was, that it
was hard on you for me to see him first, and the other way was
that if you couldn&#39;t see him, I could represent you. He is quite
a sick-looking Buddy, but very, very sweet and dear. I hope
you can get him down to the Cape and take care of him. They
won&#39;t discharge him, will they, until they get good and ready to?
He looks a lot like you and a lot like some of those Rembrandt
portraits of himself. I suppose it&#39;s his beard that makes him
look so sort of shady and shadowy. He said he didn&#39;t think he
would ever be any better, but that if he did, he hoped he could
go to Russia. He seemed to want me to think that this and everything
else he said was a joke. I must interrupt myself now,
and say au revoir, because the car is waiting, and Mother is being
very polite in it. I can see her back getting politer every minute.</p>

<p class="center">&#39;bye&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.</p>
<p>P. S. I love you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
&quot;I didn&#39;t know that your brother was as sick
as all that,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you told
me so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He doesn&#39;t want anybody told. He doesn&#39;t want
to appear like a confirmed invalid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to tell Ruthie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&#39;ll tell you what you do. You take Jeanie&#39;s
letter and read it to her. That won&#39;t be either of us
telling her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what excuse you can give for having
a strange girl&#39;s letter with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t need any excuse. I&#39;ll just say to Ruth
that I&#39;ve got a letter from a friend of yours about
John Swift. She&#39;ll just grab the letter&mdash;that&#39;s all.
I&#39;ll say you were willing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come around and tell me what she says
afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right.&quot; Peggy was making a prolonged departure,
kicking at the turf as she stood at the gate.
&quot;I&#39;ll come around this afternoon, anyway, and we&#39;ll
go and get some tutti-frutti ice-cream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, and if you hear anything more about
who those boys were, you can tell me then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, and I&#39;ll bring around that letter I was
telling you about, from Chester Reynolds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right. I guess my dinner&#39;s ready. I heard
the bell when we first got in sight of the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
At this point Grandfather appeared at the door
and seeing Elizabeth still looking in the direction of
her departing friend, he approached firmly and
grasped her by the ear, and led her, protesting, into
the house.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Huckleberries and New Friends</span></p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather came out of the north door
and shaded his eyes with his hand. He
gazed searchingly at Elizabeth&#39;s favourite
tree by the gate under which she and Peggy were
sitting with their embroidery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, I&#39;m disappointed,&quot; he murmured to
himself. &quot;I thought if I see anything of those two
girls I&#39;d ask them to go huckleberrying, but I s&#39;pose
they&#39;ve gone off down to the shore, or somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do ask us to go huckleberrying,&quot; Elizabeth
cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought they&#39;d be right out here, sitting under
that tree, like enough, doing some chore o&#39; fancy
work. It does beat all where they find to hide themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what fun!&quot; Peggy cried. &quot;He took me
huckleberrying last year, and I got four quarts in
about two hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, I am disappointed. I might&#39;s well
make up my mind to go alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will, too, if we don&#39;t hurry,&quot; Elizabeth said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
stuffing her crochet work into the pocket of her blue
linen dress. &quot;Run and get into the Ford.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather, equipped with as many shining
pails as a tinware peddler, approached the car and
stared at it gravely, though Peggy and Elizabeth
were already in possession of the back seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too bad I couldn&#39;t find those girls,&quot; he said.
&quot;Mother&#39;s put a great heap of sweaters and aprons
under the seat, so&#39;s if I should be lucky enough to
pick them up on the way. Well, Lizzie&quot;&mdash;this to
the machine&mdash;&quot;how cranky are you to-day? Crank
by name and crank by nature,&quot; he made half a dozen
ineffectual attempts at starting, and then succeeded
suddenly, jumped into the car, and they were off with
a snort and a flourish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You darling Granddaddy,&quot; Elizabeth said in his
ear, &quot;we&#39;re crazy to go huckleberrying, and Peggy
says you know all the spots where they grow thickest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, how did you get here? I dusted my
car out carefully just before I started. It don&#39;t seem
as if I could overlook a couple o&#39; girls o&#39; that size.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t have your glasses on, Granddaddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They took the road to the north, winding white
into the hazy distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The road is like a white ribbon,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and those little scrubby pines, sitting low all along
the way, are like&mdash;well, I don&#39;t know what they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
like, but I like <i>them</i>. I don&#39;t complain if the trees on
the Cape are not majestic, as they are in other
summer resorts. You see a lot more sky when the
trees are low.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You stand up for Cape Cod,&quot; her grandfather
said. &quot;It&#39;s a pretty good place. You know the
story of the old farmer who was driving back from
his wife&#39;s funeral. &#39;I lived with that woman forty
year,&#39; he said, &#39;and toward the last, I really got to
like her.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the way you feel about Cape Cod?&quot;
Peggy asked, mischievously. &quot;I thought it was the
way you felt about Lizzie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lizzie&#39;s got her good qualities, like most o&#39; the
rest of us. She ain&#39;t got much natural pride about
the way she looks, and she hates to admit that a
man is stronger than she is, but when he once gets
the best of the argument she goes along peaceable.
There&#39;s a lot o&#39; human nature to Lizzie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so excited about these huckleberries I can&#39;t
wait to get there. Don&#39;t you love to see those
clumps and clusters of dusky blue berries just waiting
to be jingled into the pail? The woods smell so
sweet, too, with the wild honeysuckle and wild roses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And wild bog cranberry and wild turnip and
wild beech plums,&quot; Grandfather added. &quot;Well,
here we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They had switched from the macadam to a road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
deep with sand through which the light car had
been ploughing for the last several minutes. There
was a cleared space before them and a path leading
into the woods beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Foller your nose,&quot; Grandfather said, &quot;and you&#39;ll
find berries enough to make huckleberry dumplings
for a regiment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth and Peggy slipped into the big gingham
aprons that Grandmother had provided, and each
slung a pail over an arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll bet I can get more than you do,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do, it&#39;s because your fingers are longer.&quot;
Elizabeth looked ruefully at her small, chubby
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but a man&#39;s reach should exceed his grasp,&quot;
Peggy said. &quot;I can quote poetry as well as your
friend, Jean, but don&#39;t ask me what that&#39;s out of,
because I don&#39;t know. My fingers are longer. I
don&#39;t know whether that makes any difference or
not, but I&#39;ll give you a handicap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I scorn your handicaps. One, two, three, go.
May the best girl win.&quot; Elizabeth shot down the
path, and the sound of the fruit beginning to spatter
into her pail was heard almost immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never saw so many blue or huckleberries in my
life. I&#39;ve got the loveliest, thickest patch&mdash;come
over here, Elizabeth,&quot; Peggy shouted from her retreat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ve got all the blue or huckleberries in the world
right here,&quot; Elizabeth mimicked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll pick a couple o&#39; minutes, and then I&#39;ll lie in
the bushes and rest a while,&quot; Grandfather said,
vanishing with a six-quart cranberry measure.</p>

<p class="indent">Later when the girls came into the clearing again
with their laden pails they found him stretched at
full length and apparently fast asleep, but beside him
was his heaping measure of berries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Granddaddy Swift,&quot; Peggy cried, &quot;when did you
pick all those?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those?&quot; he said, yawning. &quot;Oh, a couple of hours
back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I bet you&#39;ve been working your head off every
minute. We&#39;ve got three quarts apiece. Elizabeth
beat me after all, and then turned around and helped
me get mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I nearly killed myself doing it. I never want to
<i>eat</i> another huckleberry, but I am thirsty for water or
something. Don&#39;t I hear a spring?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There might be one through the trees there. I
don&#39;t know nothing about it.&quot; Grandfather pointed,
however, in a definite direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy parted the branches, and slipped into a
thread of a path which led them directly to a pool of
crystal clear water fed by a tiny stream that was
bubbling and gushing out of the earth. Protruding
from the spring were three bottles of ginger ale that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
had been so placed that the cool water splashed upon
them as it fell. On a rock close by were spread two
paper napkins with a pile of bread-and-butter sandwiches
on one and a stack of sugar-molasses cookies
on the other. Between the two, holding them down,
was a box of chocolates from New York&#39;s most
popular candy manufacturers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know nothing about it,&quot; Grandfather
said, when they dragged him to the feast, &quot;I&#39;ve
been fast asleep back there for upwards of two
hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a story-teller,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;and for a
punishment you&#39;ve got to tell us a real story as soon
as you&#39;ve had your party.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing ever tasted so good to me in my life,&quot;
Elizabeth said, as they were brushing off the crumbs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what she says after every meal she eats,&quot;
her grandfather chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s always true. Now here&#39;s your pipe and
here&#39;s your baccy, and while you&#39;re filling it, you&#39;ve
got to be thinking of a story to tell us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t tell stories,&quot; he protested. &quot;I&#39;d sing a song
if I knew any. There was a song my grandfather
used to sing to us when we were children, but I can&#39;t
remember it. The chorus went like this,&quot; he made
a great pretence of getting the pitch, and then, rocking
himself gently, sang in a solemn, sing-song
voice:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Injun pudding and pumpkin pie</span>
<span class="i0">The gray cat scratched out the black cat&#39;s eye.&quot;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">I never knew the rights of it, or what the trouble
was. Some kind of a disagreement they had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But where did the injun pudding and pumpkin pie
come in?&quot; Peggy asked. &quot;And what is injun pudding?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t show your ign&#39;rance, as Moses says,&quot;
Elizabeth put in. &quot;It&#39;s Indian pudding, and you make
it out of Indian meal and molasses, and it cooks all
day and makes whey, and eaten with ice-cream it&#39;s
perfectly heavenly. Grandma is going to show me
how to make it. I made a cake, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard about that cake,&quot; said Peggy, hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s Grandma?&quot; Grandfather inquired, innocently.
&quot;I thought we only had grandmothers
around our place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandma likes it better for me to call her that,&quot;
Elizabeth answered, blushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You needn&#39;t think you are getting out of telling
us that story,&quot; Peggy cried, &quot;tell us about the time
you went courting Grandmummy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t remember nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell us about the time you took Eliza Perkins to
the Harvest Dance,&quot; Elizabeth said, daringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, apparently you know something about it
already. Women do beat the Dutch, gossiping
along about things that happened near fifty years
ago as if &#39;twere yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
&quot;You needn&#39;t blame Grandma. I worm all her
secrets out of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll warrant you do. I calculated for her to remember
that Harvest Dance as long as she lived.
Did she tell you how she was dressed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was it a fancy dress party?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certain it was, and I went as King of the Harvest.
I had a velvet suit with corn tassels all down the
seams, and a velvet tam o&#39;shanter with a big tassel
on that. Your gram&#39;ma she was going to be Queen
o&#39; the Harvest, till we had a little tiff, and she refused
to have anything to do with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She didn&#39;t tell us that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I calculated she hadn&#39;t. Well, she went as an
apple, root and branch, all decked out in apple
blossoms, with a staff, with artificial apples growing
on it, and looking like an apple blossom herself, with
her pretty pink cheeks and all the lacy fixings in the
world trailing after her. I took Eliza Perkins, who
was the best-natured and biggest-hearted girl I ever
set eyes on, and the homeliest. Lord have mercy,
wasn&#39;t she homely! I knew &#39;twould never do to take
a pretty girl, so I picked her out to make your
grandma jealous with, and I told her so. She was
willing. &#39;I&#39;ll make Laury Ann just about jealous
enough,&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;Twouldn&#39;t do to have her too
jealous.&#39; And she certain played her part well.
Your grandma asked me to come around to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
candy pull to her house, before the evening was
over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She didn&#39;t tell me any of this, the wretched woman!&quot;
Peggy cried. &quot;Did you go to the candy pull?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I went sure enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you have a nice time?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t have the kind of time I expected,&quot;
Grandfather twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There wasn&#39;t any candy, and there wasn&#39;t any
pull.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandma was there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what did happen? Granddaddy, don&#39;t you
see me shaking with excitement and suspense?&quot;
Peggy demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Mother and me, we kind of come to an
understanding. I guess it&#39;s about time I hitched
up Lizzie and we started along. She&#39;s been a
whining and a whinnying back there for some time
now. Besides, your grandma calculates to make
huckleberry dumplings for supper. She gave me
special directions not to ask anybody in to eat &#39;em.
She allowed she was only going to have enough for
the immediate family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That means I&#39;m coming!&quot; Peggy cried. &quot;I <i>am</i>
the immediate family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know what dress Grandma had on that night&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
her pink muslin with dolman undersleeves, the one
that Ruth tried on the other day,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and you kissed her in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, force o&#39; habit is strong. Get your berries
together and hop back into the car, or I&#39;ll have to
start without you.&quot; Grandfather led the way
through the branches into the clearing where they
had left the machine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I half expected to see Lizzie grazing around without
her harness on,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Grandfather is so
convincing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You take good care o&#39; that sister of yours.&quot;
Grandfather was using most of his breath in the effort
to crank Lizzie. &quot;Don&#39;t let any o&#39; these fat boys that
is hanging around her try to run away with her.
She&#39;s too precious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He must have seen Piggy,&quot; Peggy said in an
undertone to Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was a fat boy hanging around your
grandma once.&quot; He jumped into his seat with the
agility of a boy himself, a thin boy, &quot;Giddap, giddap,
Lizzie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; Elizabeth leaned over the seat to say
into his ear, &quot;Pork Joe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a remarkable good guesser after you&#39;ve
been told. Well, Peggy, as I was saying, don&#39;t
let any young Pork Joe get that pretty sister of
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&quot;Did she say anything more to you about that
letter from Jean?&quot; Elizabeth asked, snuggling down
into the seat beside Peggy again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a word,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Piggy Chambers is
around all the time since he came down, and so I
can&#39;t get much action. By the way, they want us to
go to Provincetown with them to-morrow. Can you
go? You&#39;d better. They need chaperoning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I can. I&#39;ll have to ask, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Provincetown is way down on the tip toe of the
Cape, you know. We live in the elbow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoa, Lizzie.&quot; Grandfather threw in his clutch
and stopped with a flourish just behind two figures
who, laden with pails full of berries, and apparently
oblivious of the oncoming machine, were plodding
ahead in the dust. &quot;Want a ride, boys?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two caps were whipped off with an amazing
suddenness, exposing one blazing head of bright red
hair and one inimitable grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, thank you, sir,&quot; two voices spoke as one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One will have to ride behind and one with me,&quot;
Grandfather said. &quot;Elizabeth, these boys are Jim
Robbins&#39; grandsons, and if they are anything like old
Jim, they are good young fellows to know. They&#39;ll
tell you their own names, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The red-headed boy on the front seat turned and
smiled a trifle mischievously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m Tom Robbins, and this is my cousin, Will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
Dean, Miss Elizabeth Swift and Miss Peggy Farraday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do?&quot; Peggy said, gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do?&quot; Elizabeth echoed, demurely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain Swift is pretty good about picking up
passengers on the road, isn&#39;t he?&quot; asked the boy with
the grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you see two boys limping along in front of
you everywhere you go, something&#39;s got to be done
about it,&quot; Grandfather said good humouredly, &quot;anybody
might almost think you boys follered me on
purpose. Yesterday and day before and day before
that, I come across them hoofing it along the road,&quot;
he explained, &quot;going the same direction I was, and
scurse able to take another step.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We didn&#39;t ask you for a ride <i>to-day</i>,&quot; the red-headed
boy blushed. &quot;We didn&#39;t even know you were
on the road till we looked up and saw you about a
minute before you caught up to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s those girls giggling about?&quot; Grandfather
inquired. &quot;I can&#39;t have a minute&#39;s serious conversation
with anybody without this giggle-giggle-giggle
business going on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I know what you are smiling about,&quot; the
Dean boy lowered his voice, &quot;but honest, don&#39;t misjudge
us just on account of that post-office business.
We kind of wanted a chance to square it, you know.
Your grandfather thinks we&#39;re all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s been pretty dry weather for the gardens,
hasn&#39;t it?&quot; Tom Robbins was saying to Grandfather.
&quot;Have your vegetables suffered much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just about all they&#39;re capable of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see much prospect of a rainy spell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As fur as I&#39;m concerned, I don&#39;t know as it will
ever rain again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s too bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ankle getting better?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What ankle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one you sprained the day before yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sir, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which ankle was it, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The left&mdash;I mean, the right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suspected as much,&quot; said Grandfather, gravely.
&quot;Well, they are pretty nice, clever little girls, ain&#39;t
they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ever play checkers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your cousin play checkers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it might be good for lame ankles for you to
come around and have a game o&#39; checkers with an old
man once in a while. Always ask for me in particular
because when anybody comes around to the house,
especially when I&#39;ve got a young girl visiting me, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
like to be the one that has the privilege of saying
whether I&#39;m to home or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Captain Swift. We&mdash;we will be
glad to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our girls don&#39;t go to the post office at night, but
Saturday night around mail time they&#39;ll probably be
dishing out Indian pudding and ice-cream to anybody
that might happen along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know two fellows that might happen in,&quot; Tom
Robbins said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think those boys are really quite nice,&quot; Peggy
said, as they sat under their favourite tree after supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think they are,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but it was
rather mortifying the way they followed us in the
first place. They ought to have known better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it only needed a hint from us to make them
realize.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think boys need those hints. It&#39;s the fault of
girls if they aren&#39;t kept right up to the standard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some of the girls on the Cape are not very
particular. They are just out after a good time and
don&#39;t care how they get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that&#39;s mostly just thoughtlessness. Anyhow,
these boys haven&#39;t been a bit&mdash;well&mdash;you
know&mdash;familiar since that first minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, they haven&#39;t one bit. I think Will is quite
good fun. Did you notice how he wouldn&#39;t sit on the
seat with us for fear of crowding us, but just got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
right down on the floor and stuck his feet out? I
think that&#39;s the way they really are, and the other
was just showing off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so, too,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m
awfully glad we told Grandmother about it. She
knew who they were right away, and everything. I
wouldn&#39;t have known whether I ever ought to speak
to them again or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t every grandmother that you could tell
a thing like that to,&quot; Peggy reflected. &quot;I didn&#39;t
tell my mother. She just wouldn&#39;t have thought it
was much account. She trusts me to know the right
thing, and that&#39;s fine of her when I do know it, but
when I don&#39;t, it&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The thing about Grandmother,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;is that she remembers back so well. She knows
what it&#39;s like to be a girl, and she thinks all the things
that girls think are important. Lots of grown people
don&#39;t. She imagines right into things, but she doesn&#39;t
poke around them. She doesn&#39;t say much, either,
but when you tell her a thing she listens to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish any of my relations did that. Father just
says, &#39;All right, Peggy, I&#39;ll take it all on trust&mdash;where&#39;s
the morning paper?&#39; whatever I say to him,
and Mother says, &#39;Put in that little wisp of hair,
darling,&#39; or &#39;Look at your nails,&#39; no matter what I
say to her. Sister doesn&#39;t listen to anything anybody
says any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
&quot;Not even to Mr. Chambers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him less than anybody, but she spends all her
time with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy, don&#39;t you think she&#39;s got a heart?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s got. She kept me awake
last night by snivelling for about an hour, and when
I got so sorry for her that I couldn&#39;t help it, I went
in and tried to put my arms around her, and she just
turned me out as if I&#39;d been an interloper. I don&#39;t
know what to make of her lately. If you&#39;re looking
for a nasty grown-up sister, I&#39;d dispose of her cheap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad she&#39;s not happy,&quot; Elizabeth said, soberly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just sore at her about last
night, but I&#39;ll get over that. You remember that in
&#39;Little Women&#39; about not letting the sun go down
upon your wrath. Well, I scarcely ever do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I try not to,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;It isn&#39;t getting
angry so much that afflicts me. It&#39;s a lot of horrid,
sensitive ideas that I have. I want to be loved the
best, and have things just the way I think is about
right&mdash;and if I don&#39;t, I brood over it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m a more active nature,&quot; Peggy said.
&quot;Haven&#39;t we had fun to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weren&#39;t the huckleberries fun&mdash;from bush to
kettle, as it were? Weren&#39;t those boys cute, to get
acquainted with Grandfather?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wasn&#39;t it funny we happened to pick them up,
when they&#39;d been huckleberrying, too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
&quot;And oh! Wasn&#39;t Grandfather a darling all day&mdash;so
funny&mdash;telling stories and making little surprises,
and so nice with the boys and everything.
Oh, Peggy, don&#39;t you&mdash;love my grandfather?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly do,&quot; said Peggy, solemnly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Provincetown and a Walk in the Woods</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth enjoyed her ride to Provincetown
much more than she expected to.</p>

<p class="indent">The objectionable Mr. Piggy Chambers
shared with Ruth the soft cushions of the back seat
of the big touring car while the two girls occupied
the folding seats forward, which were, as Peggy said,
as luxurious as most stationary seats in machines of
an ordinary make. The chauffeur was in a smart
buff livery that matched the upholstery, and on either
side of Peggy and Elizabeth were sliding panels that
revealed at the touching of a button a vanity box
and a smoking kit respectively. Peggy had found
a green leather driving coat with buff facings for
herself tucked away under the chauffeur&#39;s seat,
and Mr. Chambers had produced a brown and blue
coat of soft scotch wool for Elizabeth. Ruth was
wearing a white wool cape of her own, and steadily
refused any of the additional luxuries that the owner
of the big car offered to produce.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel like an absolute traitor to Buddy to be
taking a minute&#39;s comfort,&quot; Elizabeth thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
trying to keep firmly in mind the fact that Mr. Piggy
Chambers had claimed industrial exemption from
the service through which her brother had lost his
health, and perhaps the girl he loved, &quot;but the car
does roll smoothly, and the country is beautiful, and
I&#39;m lucky to have a chance to see it, though my motives
in coming were quite unmixed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, the Cape has everything,&quot; Peggy said
with the air of a showman, &quot;salt-water ponds, and
fresh-water ponds, and hills and woods and sand-dunes.
If you want a walk through the pines to a
leafy glade, walk this way, ladies and gentlemen.
If you want rocks and breakwaters and sand-dunes
and inlets, look out of the car on the other side.
Every town has at least two or three of the oldest
windmills on Cape Cod, and dancing pavilions and
moving-picture palaces stare at us from every side,
without in the least interfering with the general
panorama.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think you have talked enough,
Peggy?&quot; Ruth suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I honestly don&#39;t, but perhaps Mr. Chambers
does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Miss Ruth&#39;s party,&quot; Mr. Chambers
smiled diplomatically. &quot;This country makes me
think of English country, in one way,&quot; he added,
smoothly. &quot;It is, of course, altogether different, but
in England, especially in the north, you get a varied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
landscape in a limited area, as you do here. This is
the only place in the states where you find just that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Cape is only eight miles across at its widest
point,&quot; Ruth said, &quot;and of course the whole scenic
effect is miniature in proportion. We&#39;ll begin to
see the sea on both sides of us presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What amuses me is the way the townships are
cut up; a township of fifteen hundred people is cut
into almost what you might call house lots. North,
South, East, West Harwich, Harwich Port, Harwich
Centre, and it doesn&#39;t take ten minutes to run
through any one of these little villages, and get into
the next.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are all very attractive,&quot; Elizabeth said,
defensively, but not very loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to show you England,&quot; Mr. Chambers
continued, in a lowered voice. &quot;I think you&#39;d like
it over there, say in a year or two, after the children
begin to get back their rosy cheeks again, and the
gardens are flourishing a bit more. The war has left
it all a bit ragged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It hasn&#39;t left <i>you</i> ragged,&quot; Elizabeth thought.
&quot;It&#39;s only left you fatter and complacenter and richer.
I wish Buddy had a million.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You look like a snow maiden in those white
clothes,&quot; Piggy Chambers was saying to Ruth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart,&#39;&quot; Elizabeth
repeated to herself. &quot;&#39;I have never called you this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
and I have no right to call you so now.&#39;&quot; That
was what her Buddy had written to Ruth Farraday,
and Ruth Farraday, not knowing, was leaning back
in Piggy Chambers&#39; great French car, and letting
him tell her that she looked like a snow maiden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My brother says that southern France is much
more beautiful&mdash;<i>was</i> much more beautiful than
England,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;He&mdash;he helped to break
the Hindenburg Line, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he?&quot; said Mr. Piggy Chambers, civilly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My&mdash;my father would have gone, I think, but
he wasn&#39;t able to get away from his business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he was in the steel business, he would have
been industrially exempted, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;he wouldn&#39;t have wanted to be industrially
exempted,&quot; was on the tip of Elizabeth&#39;s tongue,
but she remembered that she was talking to her host
of the day. &quot;It won&#39;t get me very far to be ill-bred
and impolite all of a sudden,&quot; she thought, sensibly.
&quot;Mr. Piggy Chambers might just as well
think that the members of our family are well brought
up.&quot; Provincetown reminded Mr. Chambers a
little of a Dutch fishing village, which he described
at great length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anybody would think he had just discovered
Abroad,&quot; Peggy scolded in an undertone. &quot;Ruth
likes all that travelogue stuff, because she was so
crazy to get there and couldn&#39;t. Now we are going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
to get out and walk, I am thankful to say, but if he
tries to lose us, don&#39;t let him, that&#39;s all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chambers did try to lose them. He tried
bribing them with ice-cream and they took the ice-cream,
but consumed it in time to join the two before
they had strolled more than three blocks. He suggested
that the chauffeur take the two girls in the
car to examine the Truro lights a mile or two back
from the course over which they had just come, while
he and Miss Ruth strolled along the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather stay here with Ruthie,&quot; Peggy insisted,
flatly, and Elizabeth could not determine whether
Ruth was pleased or displeased, for she made no display
of either emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she wanted us to go, I think perhaps she would
say so, but I don&#39;t know. Grown-up girls don&#39;t seem
to think they can say what they mean, the way
children do,&quot; she thought.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they were all walking along the beach,
and Elizabeth found herself walking with Ruth,
though she could not tell exactly how it had come
about. No one seemed to have planned to pair off
in that way. It just happened, though both Peggy
and Mr. Chambers seemed to be very much dissatisfied
with the arrangement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy would love a day like this,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;He&#39;s shut up in that old hospital, you know,
and he can&#39;t get out till he gets better, and he can&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
get better till he gets out. I want to get him down
to the Cape, where I can take care of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be very worried about him,&quot; Ruth
said. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know that he wasn&#39;t discharged
or anything about him, until Peggy found out all
these things through you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s been too sick to write much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He writes to you, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; Ruth said, so
very carelessly that Elizabeth&#39;s heart sank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he does. He says that I&#39;m the only girl that
answers his letters whether he writes to them or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does he expect to have girls write to him that
he doesn&#39;t take the trouble to inform of his whereabouts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he would be very pleased if they did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why&mdash;why shouldn&#39;t they?&quot; Elizabeth stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s probably devoted to dozens of girls,&quot; Ruth
said, lightly, &quot;all waiting for a personal word from
him. He&#39;s probably quite a Lothario, only little
sisters aren&#39;t supposed to know that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t exactly remember what a Lothario is,&quot;
Elizabeth said, &quot;but if you mean that he&#39;s a flirt and
I don&#39;t know it, you&#39;re just awfully mistaken. I
know things about Buddy that nobody else knows,
that he doesn&#39;t even know that I know. I know what
he&#39;s like, too, inside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
&quot;You think he&#39;s very nice inside, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Elizabeth, a little hostilely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell you a secret,&quot; said Ruth Farraday,
still very lightly and gayly. &quot;I do, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why&mdash;why do you go to Provincetown and
things with Mr. Piggy Chambers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr&mdash;Mr. <i>who</i>? Really, that&#39;s too bad of Peggy.
I&#39;ll have to speak to her.&quot; Ruth Farraday seemed
to have a sudden little coating of ice all over her.
&quot;Would you mind telling Peggy that I want to speak
to her alone a minute?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth obeyed meekly and so miserably that
Mr. Chambers, at whose side she lingered, since there
was nothing to do but take Peggy&#39;s place with him,
asked her what was wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not feeling very well,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;the
sun is so bright.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I find her rather bright myself,&quot; Mr. Piggy
Chambers murmured. &quot;Would you like to do me
a great favour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, indeed,&quot; Elizabeth said, untruthfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you take Miss Peggy and go back to the
drug store where you had your ice-cream, and buy
a five-pound box of the very best chocolates they
have? If they haven&#39;t a five-pound box, get five
one-pound boxes. Just use your own judgment
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;of course, Peggy might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
not want to go. She&mdash;I&mdash;we don&#39;t care very much
about chocolates.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Ruth does,&quot; said Mr. Chambers, decisively.
&quot;I should very much appreciate it, and we&#39;ll come
along and pick you up presently. You might like
some more ice-cream.&quot; He slipped a five-dollar
bill into her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked me if I would do him a great favour,&quot;
Elizabeth explained to the protesting Peggy, as they
turned toward the quaint street on which the little
shops were set, &quot;and I couldn&#39;t say no, could I? I
couldn&#39;t say, &#39;Thank you for your lovely ride, but
I don&#39;t feel obliging.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just wish he&#39;d asked me. I would have said
&#39;No!&#39; right out. Sister has been giving me fits because
you told her that I called him Piggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s eyes filled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not blaming you. I know you didn&#39;t spill
the beans on purpose. I just wanted to know how it
happened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just called him that. That&#39;s all,&quot; Elizabeth
said, miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, don&#39;t you care, darling,&quot; Peggy advised.
&quot;Ruth was only upset about something else, and
wanted to take it out on me. It will serve her right
if Mr. Hoggy Chambers proposes while we&#39;re gone. I
promised her I wouldn&#39;t call him Piggy any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he means to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;Well, if he does, I wonder what he&#39;ll say. Love
me and the world is mine. I guess that&#39;s about what
he will say. The world is my oyster and I&#39;ll let you
keep it in your stew, if you&#39;ll be good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Piggy Chambers,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she says &#39;yes&#39; to that freak, I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll disown her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, let&#39;s not think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t much else I can think of,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;Oh, but look! Sixty-four, sixty-five. Those
are black Portuguese, and they count.&quot; Two
swarthy fishermen in bright blouses were passing
them on the narrow street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve caught up with me,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;I
was four ahead of you for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll probably get them all just in time to shake
hands with Tommy Robbins and Billy Dean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might have to,&quot; Elizabeth argued. &quot;Supposing
we were going away and they came to say
good-bye, and held out their hands to shake hands.
We&#39;d have to shake them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d say I had a sore finger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We couldn&#39;t both say we had sore fingers. Besides,
they could see we hadn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might both have lame wrists, if we had been
doing the same thing, rowing or playing tennis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would look rather suspicious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better to look a little suspicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
than to tie yourself up for life that way, or run the
chance of it? I know who you want to shake hands
with. That Reynolds boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to shake hands with anybody,&quot;
Peggy said. &quot;We may like Tom and Bill a good deal
better before the summer is over, though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They really are quite nice,&quot; Elizabeth reflected.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Chambers is trying to get us to ride home
in the front seat, with the chauffeur. He says the
front seat is the most comfortable in the car, and
was designed for three. I told him I&#39;d think it over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see what difference it makes now. He&#39;s
talking to her alone, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it&#39;s a terrible responsibility. They are
both old enough to be married, and they ought to
be old enough to know just what they want to do,
instead of keeping a couple of kids&mdash;I mean children&mdash;worried
to death all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think Mr. Chambers knows what he wants to
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but he ought to know better than to keep
bothering a girl that doesn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth and Peggy managed to eat a plate of
ice-cream apiece in spite of their dejection, but Elizabeth
steadfastly refused to break Mr. Chambers&#39;
five-dollar bill, even to pay for the five pounds of
candy she purchased for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He can pay me the way he would a grown-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
person,&quot; she said. &quot;I prefer to buy our own ice-cream,
and do his errands on a strictly business basis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My goodness,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;I feel as if we had
suffered enough, without having to buy our own refreshments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They rode with the chauffeur only a part of the
way home, because when they had travelled twenty
miles of the forty between the tip and the elbow of
the crooked right arm of Massachusetts a tire gave
way and they all stepped out of the car and took a
walk in the woods while they were waiting for repairs
to be made.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chambers and Ruth slipped into a thread of
a path going in the opposite direction from that
taken by the two girls, but evidently made a detour
and turned again toward them, for the moment in
silence. When they heard the sound of voices just
beyond Peggy put her finger to her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am the kind of man who always gets what he
wants,&quot; Mr. Chambers was saying. &quot;You won&#39;t
give me the chance to tell you what I want, but you
know pretty well what it is, and I think you know
that I am going to get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Ruth Farraday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that I want you to marry me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that I love you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I don&#39;t know much about love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
&quot;I can teach you,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody can teach me anything that I can&#39;t find
out for myself. If I don&#39;t know what this&mdash;this
feeling people call Love is, from the inside, nobody
can come and throw it over me, like a cloak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oughtn&#39;t we to stuff our fingers in our ears?&quot;
Elizabeth pantomimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; Peggy shook her head, fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wrapping it around you like a cloak is just what
I should like to do. I should like to keep you warm
and comfortable for the rest of your life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And happy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know I could make you happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warmth comes from within, doesn&#39;t it? You
wouldn&#39;t want an icicle of a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not afraid that you would be an icicle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy was showing strong signs of disgust, but
Elizabeth was listening with parted lips and shining
eyes. She had forgotten that she was eavesdropping,
forgotten everything except that Buddy&#39;s girl did
not want to give up her chance of learning something
that Buddy could teach her. She expected the next
words when they came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would be an icicle&mdash;to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The suitor did not seem to realize the significance of
this statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All I want is a chance to melt the icicle,&quot; he said,
complacently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
&quot;Goop!&quot; said Peggy in a loud whisper. Then she
sneezed, but fortunately the speakers had passed far
enough beyond to confuse the sound with the general
blend of forest sounds, the whirring of wings in the
underbrush, or the rustling in the trees overhead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess he thought I was a startled quail,&quot;
Peggy said, &quot;though I wouldn&#39;t have cared much if
he had found me. I never heard such silliness, did
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t think it was silliness,&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;It was quite a lot the way people talk in books, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t really mushy,&quot; Peggy agreed, &quot;only
sort of peculiar. Well, I guess I am not going to
have a new brother-in-law right away. Still, I
notice she&#39;s keeping a string tied to him, just the
same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When they got back into the car Ruth suggested
that the girls take the folding seats in the tonneau
again, and Mr. Chambers quietly acquiesced in this
arrangement. As they took their places Peggy
gave her friend the benefit of a long, significant wink,
and then subsided into the silence that encompassed
them all during the remainder of the long drive home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Little Eva</span></p>

<p class="indent">I come to tell you that my mother&#39;s sick,&quot;
Moses said. &quot;She&#39;s hollering something awful.
She said to tell Miss Laury Ann, but I can&#39;t
find her nowhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s out with Grandfather,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and I don&#39;t know when she&#39;ll be back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe Marmer&#39;ll be dead by that time. She&#39;s
kind of turned green already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She can&#39;t be going to die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I arsked her was she going to die, and she said she
guessed she was. I dunno nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll go home with you,&quot; Elizabeth resolved suddenly.
&quot;I&#39;ll get Judidy, and we&#39;ll go and see what we
can do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marmer didn&#39;t tell me to get no girls,&quot; Moses said,
doubtfully, &quot;she told me to get Miss Laury Ann.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be better than nobody, Moses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you do come over to my house, I ain&#39;t
agoing to wear no bloomer suit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I shan&#39;t expect you to,&quot; Elizabeth said, hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">Judidy was nowhere to be found, so leaving word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
with Zeckal, the good-natured hired man, to send
either Judidy or her grandmother to the rescue as
soon as possible, Elizabeth followed Moses to the
tumbledown little red house that was his home. On
an old horsehair sofa in the middle of the kitchen,
which was the first room they entered, a young
woman with her blonde hair straggling into blue eyes
swimming with pain was lying in a huddled heap.
In the middle of the floor was a wash-tub full of dirty
water and half-submerged, grimy garments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was trying to git some washing done when the
pain struck me,&quot; a weak voice said. &quot;I ain&#39;t in no
condition to receive visitors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t come to visit,&quot; Elizabeth said, gently. &quot;I
came to help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A spasm of pain racked the sick woman. Elizabeth
was down on her knees beside her in an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re all corseted up!&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m going to
rip these things off,&quot; for under the trailing, ragged
garments that overlaid Mrs. Steppe she was wearing
a corset like a board. Elizabeth tore at the strings
until she released her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shouldn&#39;t lace like that,&quot; she said, in horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t lace,&quot; the sick woman breathed, &quot;my
waist is only&mdash;eighteen&mdash;inches&mdash;around. It&#39;s naturally&mdash;small.
I guess if I could only get a little
hot water to drink I would feel better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth found a one-wick kerosene stove so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
begrimed and choked with soot that she could
scarcely light the sputtering wick, but thanks to her
recent investigations in her grandmother&#39;s kitchen,
she was able to heat a little water over it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A month ago I didn&#39;t even know there was such
a thing as a one-wick kerosene stove,&quot; she thought.
She caught sight of what at first glance looked like a
small gray animal on the floor under the table. &quot;It&#39;s
nothing but a piece of moldy bread, the kind that
poor Madget was afraid would crawl out on her. Oh,
dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are the little girls?&quot; she asked, as the
sufferer sat up and drank the steaming water in the
cracked blue cup that was the only china receptacle
of any kind that Elizabeth could find.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t able to get them any breakfast, so they
went out to see if they could pick some blue berries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madget is so little she ought to have milk in the
morning.&quot; Elizabeth could not refrain from making
this superfluous suggestion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Milk sours so.&quot; The spasm of pain that attacked
her was of longer duration this time. Elizabeth
began rubbing the afflicted area, and calling to
Moses, who presently appeared, and gazed at his
mother speculatively as she winced and writhed in
agony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go and get a doctor, Moses. Any doctor you
know about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t believe in doctors,&quot; Mrs. Steppe
breathed. &quot;I&mdash;I believe in spirit healing. Get a
medium.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You get a doctor, Moses,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Tell
him that I&mdash;Captain John Swift&#39;s granddaughter&mdash;will
settle the bill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; Moses said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know much about mediums,&quot; she explained
to the sick woman, &quot;but I know that a doctor
would be able to help you right away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I don&#39;t believe in medical healing,&quot; the woman
moaned, &quot;but if you want to spend your money that
way&mdash;the last time&mdash;I had a sick spell, Mis&#39; Abithy
Hawes, she&#39;s a fine medium, she&mdash;come here and went
into a trance&mdash;and had me cured in half an&mdash;hour.
No doctor&mdash;could do&mdash;do like that. Her control
is&mdash;Little Eva.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t try to talk,&quot; Elizabeth said, mystified.</p>

<p class="indent">The next half hour was one that she remembered
all her life. The spasms of pain increased. Elizabeth&#39;s
experience of acute illness was so limited that
she earnestly believed she had a dying woman on her
hands. Madget and Mabel came in whimpering and
hungry, and Madget cried steadily and consistently
from the moment when she caught her first glimpse of
her mother&#39;s tortured face. Mrs. Steppe continued
to call for Mis&#39; Abithy Hawes, and Elizabeth finally
thought of sending Mabel to look for that lady.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Mabel returned from this quest with amazing
promptitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She had her hands in the flour dough,&quot; Mabel
explained, &quot;and she can&#39;t come. She sent word
that she couldn&#39;t have no trances till she got
her work done up, and then she&#39;d see. She give me
a cookie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you explain to her how sick your mother
was?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she said she couldn&#39;t have no trances now.
She said Little Eva was cranky to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By the time Moses appeared, with the word
that the doctor would follow him shortly, Elizabeth
was at the limit of her endurance and her
ingenuity. She had been heating water in a leaky
lard pail, and stripping off her own white petticoat to
make hot compresses to relieve the increasing pain
of her patient, quieting the ubiquitous Madget for a
few seconds at a time only to provoke the din again
as soon as she set her down from her lap; and trying
in the intervals to reduce the slovenly room to something
like order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she dead yet?&quot; Moses inquired, solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Moses, dear,&quot; she said, &quot;you mustn&#39;t talk like
that. It&#39;s unfeeling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; he said with unexpected docility, &quot;I
won&#39;t. I just wanted to make some plans, that&#39;s all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
I thought I might come to live with you, if Marmer
died.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth put her arms around the forlorn little
figure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She isn&#39;t going to die,&quot; she said, &quot;at least, I don&#39;t
think she is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you can&#39;t tell,&quot; said Moses, skeptically.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor, who proved to be a portly being with a
red beard and the kindest eyes Elizabeth had ever
seen, as she told Peggy afterward, explained that the
seizure was nothing more serious than neuralgia
complicated with a slight gastric attack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lack of nourishment, lack of exercise, lack of any
sort of proper care for mind or body,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is neuralgia?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Starved nerves in revolt is one way of putting
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought she had appendicitis or pleurisy or
something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has nothing that a week&#39;s care won&#39;t
bring her out of. If she isn&#39;t looked out for at
least for that length of time the trouble is likely to
increase. There isn&#39;t anybody to take care of her, is
there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there is nobody but me,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor looked at her under quizzical eyebrows
with an expression that reminded her of her grandfather.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
&quot;Give her this medicine regularly,&quot; he said, as if he
found nothing remarkable in her statement, &quot;and
see that she has three nourishing meals a day and
keep her quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s easier to keep her quiet when you are here,&quot;
Elizabeth said, indicating the awestruck Madget,
Moses, and Mabel, who stood in a respectful row, at a
respectful distance from the great man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand these children are always quiet when
they&#39;re asleep or when the doctor comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;the better they feel that
they know you the more noise they make. They
treat me like an old friend now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to live in New York myself,&quot; the doctor
observed, &quot;and I miss it a good deal more than most
people suspect. I know all about you, you see. I
know pretty well all the news of the comings and
goings in town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a New Yorker, and yet you stay down here
all the year round,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I don&#39;t see
how you can, if you really liked New York.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I liked New York,&quot; he said, &quot;but you can&#39;t be a
country doctor on Broadway. I&#39;d rather take care
of these people than those.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They need it more,&quot; he said, simply. &quot;In a big
city you don&#39;t get the same chance to find out what
people do need. It isn&#39;t always sick bodies a doctor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
is called in to look out for, you know. A doctor
down here has to be a kind of a lawyer and a justice of
the peace and a plumber, into the bargain. In New
York he doesn&#39;t get that kind of an opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That seems a funny kind of thing to call an opportunity,
I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is one, though,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Where is
these children&#39;s father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s on a coal barge. He only gets home once
in a while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He must make pretty good money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does, only she&mdash;&quot; Elizabeth, who had
walked to the door with him, and was standing just
outside it as they talked, indicated the woman in the
room beyond&mdash;&quot;spends it on candy and novels and
things, and then he gets discouraged, and doesn&#39;t
send it to her, or drinks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, call me again if you need me. No, I won&#39;t
send you the bill. There isn&#39;t any bill. I&#39;m paid
already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he didn&#39;t mean that it paid him just to
see me here doing good,&quot; Elizabeth thought, when
she realized that that was what he did mean. &quot;I
don&#39;t want him thinking I&#39;m always looking after the
poor when this is the first time I ever did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The children crowded around her when the doctor
left.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mother is going to be well in a week,&quot; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
told Moses. &quot;I&#39;m going to wash your face, Mabel&mdash;and
Madget, if you don&#39;t stop crying, do you know
what I&#39;m going to do to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spank me!&quot; wailed Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m going to kiss you, but I guess
it would be more to the purpose to feed you. What
does your mother make oatmeal in when she makes
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She don&#39;t make none,&quot; Mabel said. &quot;Can you
make oatmeal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could follow the directions on the package, I
guess. I can make cake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want some cake,&quot; cried Madget, promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth was trying to get some water &quot;boiling,
foaming, scalding hot,&quot; according to directions, when
Judidy appeared at the door, her moon face beaming
over various pails and packages.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Land o&#39; Liberty!&quot; she said. &quot;You up here
a-tending the sick, and me out skylarking with my
feller. I brought some milk and sandwiches for the
children. I guess she ain&#39;t sick much, is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m dretful sick, Judidy,&quot; a voice from the couch
said, weakly; &quot;I had the doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you was a spiritualist, and didn&#39;t
believe in no medicine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe that no doctor could doctor me as
well as Little Eva could, but Mis&#39; Hawes she couldn&#39;t
come. I was too sick to depend on a contrary control,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
so we called the doctor, and he left me some
kinder dark stuff to take, and some light-coloured
pills that&#39;s kind o&#39; quieting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Do</i> tell,&quot; said Judidy, politely. &quot;Now you
drink to where I&#39;ve got my finger,&quot; she instructed
Madget, as she held out the milk bottle, which
the children were trying to reach, &quot;then Mabel,
then&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pour a little out in this cup, and I&#39;ll feed Madget
myself,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I guess the other children
had better drink out of the bottle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Judidy looked at Elizabeth admiringly as she
lifted the little girl on her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My, ain&#39;t you a pretty picture,&quot; she said, heartily.
&quot;You was just as stuck up, when you first came,
with your ideas about having a demi-tassy after you
had et, and laffing at the pump in the kitchen, and
never eating anything between meals, and to see
you now, a-taking up with the town&#39;s poor as if
they was own relations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you call us town&#39;s poor,&quot; Mrs. Steppe
said, sitting up suddenly, and then falling back with
a groan. &quot;I ain&#39;t never been called such a name,
Judidy Eldredge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You just lay still,&quot; Judidy said, &quot;and don&#39;t you
worry. I&#39;ll stay now, Elizabeth, and you can go
home and get ready for your dinner. It&#39;s a lucky
thing I had it all arranged to have a day off on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
of my feller being home. Miss Laury Ann
she told me to send you as soon as I got here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t want you to have to lose a day with
your&mdash;feller,&quot; Elizabeth said, trying not to be guilty
of the rudeness of correcting Judidy&#39;s pronunciation.
&quot;I&#39;ll come back as soon as Grandma will let me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget began to whimper as she set her down, but
Moses assured her that if his marmer died, he would
&quot;come over there right away and tell her about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whatever makes him so pleased to
think of my dying,&quot; his mother said, plaintively,
&quot;he has never known anybody that died or anything,
if he is always burying birds with regular funeral
preaching.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He doesn&#39;t want you to die,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;he
just gets ideas in his mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they aren&#39;t very cheerful ideas for a sick
woman to hear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, they aren&#39;t,&quot; Elizabeth agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I can get Mis&#39; Hawes over here, Little Eva
will tell me if I&#39;m going to die. I&#39;d like to lick Moses
once, anyway, whether I&#39;m going to die or not.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think anybody could &#39;a&#39; done any better,&quot;
her grandmother said, when she told her the story.
&quot;Hot compresses is the thing that always relieves
pain, and what the whole situation needed was somebody
to take charge and send for the doctor. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
was a pretty brave, practical girl, I should say. The
Swifts always had good contrivance, and come out
strong when there was anything real to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think that I managed so very well. The
children kept crying and I couldn&#39;t stop them, and
Mrs. Steppe kept asking for a medium that I couldn&#39;t
get for her. What does she mean by Little Eva being
Mrs. Hawes&#39; control?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To her surprise her grandmother began to laugh,
and laughed until the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose it <i>is</i> funny,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but I
never thought of it that way. I suppose it&#39;s funny
about Moses keeping on asking if his mother was
going to die, but it didn&#39;t seem funny at the time, it
just seemed queer and&mdash;and awfully hard to manage.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&quot; to her chagrin, her lip began to tremble.
&quot;What&mdash;what is a control, anyway?&quot; she wailed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ain&#39;t nothing that you got to bother with just
at present,&quot; her grandmother said, &quot;you come here.&quot;
She sank into one of the numerous valanced rockers
conveniently placed about the house, and held out
her arms. &quot;You come here&mdash;to Grandma,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll think I&#39;m an awful baby,&quot; Elizabeth
sobbed on the comfortable bosom, snuggling a little
closer in the protecting embrace. &quot;It isn&#39;t so much
what I&#39;ve done that I mind, but what I&#39;ve got to do.
It isn&#39;t very brave of me, but I dread taking care of
that awful woman for a whole week. She&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
isn&#39;t very grateful, or anything. She&#39;d rather have
a medium. But&mdash;but the children&mdash;they love me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth,&quot; her grandmother said, &quot;I ain&#39;t
a-going to let you go there for any week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s my duty, Grandmother. You aren&#39;t
going to stop me doing my duty, are you? You
can&#39;t spare Judidy, and there isn&#39;t anybody else.
There aren&#39;t any real servants or charity organization
societies here. I don&#39;t see what there is to do
but just what Doctor Hartly does, go around and be
anything that the people need you for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t be all things to all men, Elizabeth,&quot;
her grandmother said, sagely. &quot;If you can be like
that Holland boy I&#39;ve heard tell of, that put his hand
through a hole in the wall and kept the water from
destroying a whole town, that&#39;s one thing, but the
kind of a hole that the water&#39;ll roll through forever,
the minute you take your arm out, is another. The
Steppe family is going to be in need of any person&#39;s
full strength as long as Mis&#39; Steppe continues to
breathe, and we can&#39;t wish anybody&#39;s breath to stop,
in spite of Moses. The best you can do for any set
o&#39; people in that condition is just what you went
and done to-day. Look out for &#39;em when they get
way down, give &#39;em what extry strength and vittles
you got at all times, but don&#39;t try to lift &#39;em up unless
you can lift &#39;em all the way out. Mis&#39; Steppe will
always sag back from her own weight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Elizabeth sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t you think
she could be reformed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She might, and then again she mightn&#39;t. I
should say she couldn&#39;t be. She&#39;s always trying to
get something for nothing, that woman is. This
business of getting a medium to get her control to
fix up things she&#39;s too lazy to fix for herself that&#39;s
Mis&#39; Steppe all over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is a control?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A control is a spirit guide that takes possession
of a medium when she goes into a trance. Somebody
that has lived and died, usually somebody
kind o&#39; tricky, that has a hard time getting into communication
with whoever &#39;tis they want to talk to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that&#39;s just pure faking, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whether &#39;tis or not. I don&#39;t understand
it. My idea is, never to make too light of a
thing that I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t think there is a Little Eva, do you,
Grandma?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t, but Mis&#39; Hawes does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn&#39;t think there was anything to do but
laugh at Little Eva.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So wouldn&#39;t anybody, first off, but spiritualism
is some people&#39;s religion. It ain&#39;t mine, but in general
it ain&#39;t a good idea to laugh at anybody&#39;s religion,
not even the cannibals&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall we do about the Steppes, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m going to get Judidy&#39;s sister to go over there
and stay what she can. What she can&#39;t, you and
me and Judidy&#39;ll make up between us. We&#39;ll have
a kind of general care of &#39;em till they get out o&#39; this
particular patch o&#39; woods. Then they&#39;ll have to go
on their own gait again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does seem sort of awful, not to really do anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it does, but the thing to do is to keep people
like that in the back of your mind, and when any
chance comes that might benefit &#39;em, not to be too
lazy to pass it along. I&#39;m kind of arguing with your
grandfather about taking Moses to come and live
with us. I ain&#39;t pushing the matter, but kind o&#39;
working along easy. I&#39;ve got an idea of getting Mis&#39;
Steppe interested in a different class o&#39; books. Any
woman that&#39;ll get the notion out of a book that she
can wear a eighteen-inch corset around her waist
under her rags and stick to it can get some other
more practical notion through her head in time.
Anyhow, that&#39;s one thing to work on. I ain&#39;t very
hopeful, but I thought of it. I keep at the Steppes,
and little by little I hope to get something accomplished.
I see that the children is fed up about once
a day anyway, but I don&#39;t stick my wrist through
the hole o&#39; their shiftlessness, I just bail out a little
water as often as I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That <i>is</i> the way, isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
just thought I&#39;d have to go there and practically
live for weeks. It&mdash;it seemed like a bottomless
pit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ain&#39;t really no such thing as a bottomless
pit,&quot; Grandmother said, sagely; &quot;there are only pits
that we can&#39;t plumb the bottom of.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">She told the story of Elizabeth&#39;s activities to
Grandfather that night and this time she did not
laugh, even in recapitulating the difficulties the little
girl had encountered in relation to Mrs. Steppe&#39;s
religious convictions and her constant demand for
Little Eva. On the contrary, she wiped her eyes
quite openly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was calculating to go there,&quot; she said, &quot;and
take entire charge of that miserable Steppe family
without any help from anybody, nurse that sick
woman and feed those children for a week and longer
if it was required of her. She would have done it,
too, if I hadn&#39;t put a stop to it. I wish you could
have seen that pretty, anxious little face, and those
great eyes of hers brim full o&#39; tears but game as a
fightin&#39; cock. I do wish you could have seen her,
Father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could of,&quot; said Grandfather, gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just one thought come into my mind as I set
there talking to her, and it come so strong I almost
up and said it aloud before I caught myself. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
thinking o&#39; that first night she come, and the dejected
way you sat in that chair there, after she had gone
up to bed, and I said to myself, holding her there in
my lap all exhausted and quivering, after a whole
forenoon spent doing battle with the slothfulness of
the Steppe family, &#39;Father Swift,&#39; I said to myself,
&#39;what do you think o&#39; John&#39;s girl now?&#39; I said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear what I spoke up and answered?
Well, you couldn&#39;t &#39;a&#39; been listening very hard. When
you said that, I had my answer ready to the dot. &#39;I
think a whole lot better of her,&#39; that&#39;s what I said,
&#39;and I have been doing so for some time back&#39;.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Buddy Wants to Know</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth had been to tea with the Farradays.
The big, closed-in porch, which
was practically their summer living room,
gay with chintzes and strewn with all the appurtenances
of luxurious modern existence, always gave her
a little feeling of homesickness for the life to which she
was used in town. The trim maid, quietly manipulating
the tea wagon laden with the delicacies of the
usual teatime meal, took on an almost pathetic
glamour to the little exile.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chambers was in possession of the wicker
chaise-longue. Ruth had poured tea with deft and
dainty fingers, though she was unusually silent, even
for her. Mrs. Farraday, who was as unlike Elizabeth&#39;s
mother as it was possible for her to be, had yet,
in a gown of blue linen, with rose-coloured net cuffs
and neck piece, managed to suggest her vividly.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy had behaved abominably. In intervals of
passing cakes she had managed to get out of the line
of vision and stand grimacing and contorting her
face at Elizabeth. Usage demanded that Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
return these impudent salutations in kind, and twice
Peggy nearly made her do so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have been mortified,&quot; she thought, &quot;if
Mr. Piggy Chambers had caught me making faces,
especially since I would naturally make that kind of
faces about him, if it happened so. I guess Ruth
would never speak to me again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; Peggy whispered, &quot;these tea
fights on the veranda, with Piggy&mdash;I mean Hoggy&mdash;Chambers
and Mother knitting as if she had just
eaten the canary, and Ruthie saying nothing and
sawing wood, and the other self-sufficient member
of our little circle sitting there and owning the
universe&mdash;they just make me wild. I feel as if
I would like to get an Indian tomahawk and scalp
&#39;em all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I like tea on your veranda, though,&quot; Elizabeth
couldn&#39;t help admitting. &quot;Grandmother would
think afternoon tea was ridiculous, and I am used
to it in my own home. I&#39;m used to having my own
mother around, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If your own mother were aiding and abetting the
slaughter of your innocent sister,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;you
might not feel so excruciatingly fond of her. I
didn&#39;t make that remark all up. Father said it first.
Our family is just completely mixed up over the whole
affair. There&#39;s one ray of light. Ruthie isn&#39;t mushy
about any of it. Only she makes me nervous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t see how you can bear it at all,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;I can&#39;t, hardly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can hardly, Miss Swift,&quot; Peggy mocked. &quot;You
are more sensitive to things than I am, I guess. I
throw &#39;em off after I&#39;ve howled for a while. My
idea would be to fill Piggy&#39;s bed with flour and hair-brushes,
or to stick a hair-pin in his tires. You&#39;d
just give him mental treatment and take it awfully
to heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that&#39;s why we get on so well together.
Opposites attract opposites.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I were a man I think I should want to marry
you, Elizabeth, but if I were a girl, I don&#39;t think I
should want to be just like you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s not very flattering, because you are a girl
already, and you couldn&#39;t be a man if you wanted to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean for myself I would like to be like you.
You take things harder than I do. I can always go
out and punch something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There never seems to be anything I can punch,&quot;
said poor Elizabeth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Peggy had walked with her as far as her own gate,
and then she had gone in to get her belated morning
mail. She had been so sure that there was no one to
write to her until she had answered the letters with
which her portfolio was stuffed that she had neglected
to go to the post office as usual. She found, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
a long letter from her brother and one from her
mother. Buddy wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Little Sister</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I am going to take you into my confidence in an important
matter because, well, there is nobody else that I can ask any help
of. You needn&#39;t get peeved at this way of putting it, because it
stands to reason that if you weren&#39;t a pretty reliable little sport
I wouldn&#39;t trust you. I don&#39;t have to. I only do.&mdash;Hope to
die, and cross your heart?&mdash;Thank you.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, the thing is, I want to know something about Ruth
Farraday. For reasons of my own I haven&#39;t been writing to
her. Now, I might like to write to her once or twice, a friendly
little note, you understand. A fellow gets so doggone lonesome.
They won&#39;t let me go until they&#39;re satisfied I&#39;m fixed up. How
you are going to fix up a fellow who has got some of the things
I&#39;ve got the matter with me, I don&#39;t know. They think it&#39;s
shell shock, among other things. Well, among other things, it
isn&#39;t shell shock, it&#39;s&mdash;&mdash;Oh, well, it isn&#39;t shell shock. It&#39;s
darned old discouragement, and homesickness for the things that
never were on land or sea. That&#39;s poetry, my darling sister. I
have some of that in my system, too.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I&#39;ve been here alone so long that I want to know everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>
about the people I care about. Ruth
Farraday is one that I do care something about. She was
mighty nice to me before I went to be a soldier. I think she
would have been nicer if I had worked it around to get a commission
instead of just plain enlisting, but this is only just conjecture.
She is a beautiful girl, and her heart is in the right place wherever
it is, but Sister, that&#39;s what I want to know. You&#39;re fooling
around with the Farradays so much, you ought to get some line
on this. I don&#39;t want to be idiot enough to start the poor, sick
old friend stuff, <i>if</i> she&#39;s got her mind all off me or anybody that
looks like me, and on somebody that doesn&#39;t. Does she wear a
ring, and is she reported to be free or <i>cinched</i>, or <i>what</i>?</p>

<p class="indent">I can&#39;t stand not knowing any longer. That&#39;s the point. I
may have been a darn fool in the way I&#39;ve warned you against
talking to her about me. I&#39;ve just had all these notions one after
another, kind of feverishly. I&#39;m going to write to her if you advise
me to. Don&#39;t go making up anything. Tell me the truth.
I&#39;ve got to know it, Kid. I&#39;m just all in&mdash;that&#39;s all.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Buddy</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She opened her Mothers letter with eyes so full of
tears she could scarcely distinguish its import.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Dear</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">It is getting harder and harder to be away from you, especially
since there is no immediate hope of Buddy&#39;s release. The poor
boy doesn&#39;t get better. It is difficult to understand all the intricacies
of the doctor&#39;s diagnosis. New conditions of warfare and
of life breed new conditions of disease, physical and mental, he
says, as well as new kinds of wounds and injuries, to be patiently
handled by the new medicine and surgery. To a mother&#39;s eye,
Buddy seems to be suffering from an old-fashioned set of causes
and effects. But I don&#39;t know. All I know is that Buddy is not
getting better, and that he has to be handled more carefully than
ever. Elizabeth, dear, let me warn you again to be careful what
you write him. He looks forward to your letters with the greatest
interest, and yet when they come, to be perfectly frank, they
often seem to fret him or to make him irritable. Perhaps you
had best not mention your friends the Farradays. He used to
know Ruth Farraday quite well, and sometimes the mention of
these boys and girls that he used to have so many gay times with
seems to make him morose. At other times he likes to look back
at things he used to do. He is only a little boy, after all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
Twenty-three doesn&#39;t seem much more to me than fourteen does,
in spite of that stern look he has that all the men who have
done any real fighting seem to come back with.</p>

<p class="indent">My darling, take care of your health. Don&#39;t go out in all
weathers without being suitably attired for cold or wet, as the
case may be. Your letters are a great comfort to me. You
are good to help Grandmother so much. She appreciates it, and
so does</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mother</span>.</p>

<p>P. S. I wish I might have tasted that cake you made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mother,&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;Oh, you can&#39;t
help me the least little bit in this, can you? What is
the best thing for me to do for my Buddy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She tried to talk with her grandmother, very carefully,
for fear of betraying Buddy&#39;s confidence, but
for once her grandmother did not help her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t a very good idea for little girls to think
too much about such things,&quot; she said. &quot;Love is a
mystery. One heart kinder gets clinging to another
heart, and nobody knows how it all come about, or
how to stop it. When your time comes it is about
like your time coming to die or be born, and you can
only pray that it ain&#39;t going to be too hard, with
anybody concerned in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Grandmother, if you loved anybody and you
were a man, and&mdash;and didn&#39;t tell her so because you
were poor or anything, and she was all mixed up
with somebody else, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
&quot;Well, I ain&#39;t going to be called on to be a man just
at present,&quot; Grandmother said, &quot;and I guess that&#39;s
just as well, for anybody that&#39;s got to make blueberry
cake and biscuits for supper. Your grandfather is
going to Hyannis to get a watermelon, perhaps you&#39;d
like to go with him for the ride.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would, only I&#39;ve got to write a letter to Buddy.
He&mdash;he wants me to write him right away about
something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, give him Grandma&#39;s love and tell him to
come down to the old place and get well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to write Buddy just the way I would
want to be written to if I was in love with Ruth
Farraday,&quot; Elizabeth decided, &quot;only I am going to
remember that he is sick. Supposing I was sick and
supposing I was in trouble about something that was
making me sicker, how would I want to be written
to? Oh, dear Lord,&quot; she said, closing her eyes,
suddenly, &quot;help me to write that kind of a letter and
to get it right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She climbed the stairs slowly and opened the desk
in her little room. The sisters Faith, Hope, and
Charity smiled benignly down at her, as she began
to write:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Buddy</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Cross my heart and hope to die. I am quite a lot more grown
up than I was when you knew me, and I understand the sacredness
of confidences as I didn&#39;t at that time. You don&#39;t need
to worry about trusting me. I love Ruth Farraday very much,
and I should think anybody might.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, she is not a happy girl. There is a man called Mr. Piggy
Chambers&mdash;that is what Peggy calls him, anyway&mdash;who is
in love with her and asked her to marry him. I heard him that
day that I went to Provincetown with him in his car. I did not
tell you that I went to Provincetown with him, because I do not
like him anyway, and I did not want you to think I would go
motoring with a man like that. The fact was that I went to
chaperone him and her. Well, she told him that he could not
teach her love because she would be an icicle to him, and she said
she did not know much about love anyway, but he insisted, to no
purpose. I ought to have stuffed my ears, and so had Peggy,
but some way we didn&#39;t.</p>

<p class="indent">The only drawback is that he is around the place all the time,
and does not seem to be discouraged in any way. Peggy is
furious at him. Whenever I see him on their porch eating, in
that wicker chaise-longue they have, I cannot tell you how I
despise him, in spite of his being really very nice, if you like that
kind. He doesn&#39;t seem to have any neck, to speak of, and his
collars look as if they would choke him. His eyes are small,
though bright and animated looking.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth Farraday comes here a great deal, and she asks for you
sometimes, too. She loves Grandmother more than anybody
does outside of the family. Their eyes look lovingly at each
other even when they are not speaking, you know, like cousins
or something. She is very kind to me, and never neglects a
chance to do nice things for me. I told you how Granddaddy
kissed her. She is sweet. She is just sweet. If I loved her,
Buddy&mdash;(you told me not to talk this way to you once, but I am
going to)&mdash;I would tell her I did, in some way. She is awfully
little, for a girl as old as she is, and people protect her. Peggy
protects her in a great many ways, and I know she is not happy.</p>

<p class="indent">I guess there is one thing that I ought to repeat. Yesterday
she said, &quot;How is your brother?&quot; and I said, &quot;He is about the
same,&quot; and she said, &quot;I&#39;ve just discovered how ill he has been.
I wish I had known it before,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, he might get
discharged soon,&quot; because I didn&#39;t know what else to say. She
said, &quot;I should have written him, if I had thought he cared.&quot;
Well, what could I say? I didn&#39;t say anything, because you have
warned me so against blabbing. Then she said, &quot;I can&#39;t write
him now very well. I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, so this is about all I know. I wish it were something
helpful, but it seems like nothing at all. I am only trying to
write as I would be written by. (See the Golden Rule.) If I
have not made you sicker, and you love me into the bargain,
please tell me so. When you are fourteen, responsibility frightens
you a good deal. At fifteen or sixteen, you throw it off better.
If you tell me anything to say to Ruth Farraday, I will say it.
She is certainly sweet, and I certainly love her, and she is certainly
not a happy girl.</p>

<p class="right">Your sister
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">P. S. That day we went to Provincetown, when I was walking
alone with her, she said you were probably devoted to dozens
of girls, and I said positively that you weren&#39;t. She said she
would tell me a secret, and that was, that she thought you were
very nice. It doesn&#39;t sound much to write it, but I think she
meant it, in spite of laughing at it when she said it. She is
certainly sweet. I would write to her, if it was me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She made a special trip to the post office to mail
this letter, and as she dropped it into the slot, she
had a moment of dizziness, as if the floor of the post
office had suddenly shaken itself under her feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
Even the blueberry cake did not tempt her to eat
very heartily at supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth is growing up too fast,&quot; her grandmother
complained, &quot;watermelon and blueberry
cake don&#39;t interest her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I been trying to interest her with the account
of the young red-head that rode with me to Hyannis
when she wouldn&#39;t go along. He&#39;s a pretty likely
young chap, mad about electricity, he says, and going
to study to be an electrical engineer, but Elizabeth
is too old for such light talk. Can&#39;t we think o&#39;
something solid that&#39;ll kind o&#39; get her attention?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She don&#39;t feel very well to-night, I guess. Leave
her alone, Father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t feel sick,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;but I feel
about ninety years old. I&#39;ll just go and sit in Granddaddy&#39;s
lap after supper and braid his beard, so there
won&#39;t be any hard feeling.&quot; She liked nowadays
to make her grandfather the kind of answer that
would please him.</p>

<p class="indent">She crept away to bed as early as she could, and
lay with throbbing temples against the cool white
pillows in Great-grandmother&#39;s guest-chamber bed,
wondering if she had written wisely to her sick brother
and praying that she might have helped, not hindered,
his recovery.</p>

<p class="indent">It was two days later that Peggy came to her with
a troubled face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
&quot;We&#39;ve been having ructions over at our house,&quot;
she said, &quot;and I&#39;m frightened. Mother and Ruth
have had an awful row. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s coming
out. Mother is trying to egg Ruthie on to take
Piggy for her lawful wedded. Anyhow, she claims
Ruth ought to take him or leave him, with an accent
on the <i>take</i>. Mother doesn&#39;t believe much in this
soft stuff, you know. She wants everybody comfortable,
without any rowing over expenses. She
likes people to settle down and have large families,
and large limousines, and large dinner parties, and
so on. Her cry is that the country is going to
the dogs, and our young men are all lame, halt, and
blind from the late war, so why not pick a soft spot
and let yourself down in it? She would. She wants
Ruth to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Peggy, would you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what I should do,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;I
like the people I like awfully. I&#39;d rather be with
them than be bothered. I don&#39;t see much use in
being married, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;I&#39;ve thought it
might be rather nice to be <i>just</i> married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Ruth, she&#39;s a puzzle to me. Something&#39;s
eating her&mdash;&#39;scuse my elegance&mdash;I don&#39;t know
whether it&#39;s wanting to be married, or not wanting
to be. She told Mother that she&#39;d rather be the
wife of a poor man that she was keen on, than to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
a million. Mother said that Piggy Chambers had
four million. Ruth said that made about two, or
one and one half, since the purchasing power of a
dollar was so reduced. I didn&#39;t know Ruthie had it
in her to talk back that way. Mother said that the
purchasing power of a dollar was reduced for our
family as well as anybody&#39;s, did she ever think of
that? And that girls were an expensive luxury
nowadays. Whereupon Ruthie said that she hadn&#39;t
thought of that, but she would, if that was the way
Mother looked at it. Mother said it wasn&#39;t, but
that was the way somebody a little more practical
than Ruthie might have looked at it for themselves.
Then she said that Ruth had been playing with
Piggy, or nobody would have had any reason to
think of the matter at all. It was all pretty raw, you
know. I wouldn&#39;t tell any other soul on earth, but
someway you are different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A lot of people tell me things,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and I love Ruth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your family is different,&quot; Peggy sighed. &quot;If
Ruthie and I lived all alone, we&#39;d be different. I
wish you&#39;d come on over to the house with me, Elizabeth.
I&#39;m honestly almost afraid to go home. The
atmosphere is so thick, you couldn&#39;t cut it with a
knife unless it had just been sharpened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, I will,&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;I was
coming over there anyway. Grandma thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
would cheer me up. I&#39;ve been sort of mopey, myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s about as cheerful in the cottage as if it
was a nice, cozy morgue, but perhaps we can amuse
ourselves with croquet and raspberry shrub. Truth
compels me to state that Cook has just completed
a mocha-frosted cake with an icing about
six feet high. Do we get any of that? The answer
is, probably not, but while there is life there is
hope.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know that you have an awfully funny
mind, Peggy? Amusing, I mean, and brilliant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a pretty embarrassing way for you to talk
to an old friend,&quot; Peggy said, but she blushed in
spite of her light laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello! Daddy&#39;s come,&quot; she cried, as they approached
the Farraday porch. &quot;That makes it even
more exciting, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. and Mrs. Farraday were engaged in earnest
conversation as the two girls opened the screen door
and stepped into the dainty space within.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, Daddy, dearest,&quot; Peggy cried, flying to kiss
him, &quot;this is a darling, unexpected pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Farraday had a nice smile. He looked very
much like his younger daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruth phoned me to come down,&quot; he said.
&quot;How&#39;s my son?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s feeling a lot better, dear, since she knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
you&#39;re in the house,&quot; Peggy flashed back. &quot;I&#39;m the
only son he&#39;s got, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father and I were talking, dear,&quot; Mrs.
Farraday&#39;s smooth tones intervened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth and I only looked in to see Cook, <i>in
re</i> a large cake she&#39;s been making.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Farraday looked up. &quot;Here comes Ruth
and Mr. Chambers, so you may as well stay here.
I&#39;ve told Cook to serve that cake with our tea to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have your good points, Mother,&quot; Peggy
said, saucily.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth threw up her small head as she came out of
the house. She was very pale, Elizabeth noticed, and
Mr. Chambers was very red. He was smiling, but
Ruth&#39;s face was entirely grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you are here, Father,&quot; she said, &quot;for I
have an announcement to make to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I go?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, dear, I want you to stay. It&#39;s not a secret.
It is merely that Mr. Chambers has asked me to
marry him, and I have said that I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Lord!&quot; Peggy cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you want me for a brother-in-law, Miss
Peggy?&quot; Mr. Chambers asked. &quot;You don&#39;t sound
very much pleased at our news.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want any brother-in-law very much,&quot;
Peggy said, &quot;but I do want my sister to do what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
wants to, and&mdash;and to be happy,&quot; she finished,
lamely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Mr. Farraday said.
&quot;I feel just about the way Peggy does. If&mdash;if you&#39;re
both sure, you have my blessing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What nonsense!&quot; Mrs. Farraday cried. &quot;Of course
they are both sure, and of course they have our
blessing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How about you, little Miss Elizabeth?&quot; Piggy
Chambers smiled at her and held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I congratulate you,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And me?&quot; asked Ruth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you,&quot; Elizabeth said, not quite able to keep
her voice steady, &quot;if you want to be congratulated by
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kiss me, dear.&quot; Mrs. Farraday slipped an arm
around her daughter&#39;s shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Ruth, sharply, &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see why anybody should want to kiss
anybody,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;It&#39;s too exciting, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s rather usual,&quot; Mr. Farraday murmured,
&quot;or it used to be, before this modern generation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A telegram for Miss Ruth,&quot; the maid came in and
crossed the porch to present it.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth looked a little dully at the yellow envelope on
the silver tray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who can be telegraphing now?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;Shall I open it, Sister?&quot; Peggy put out her hand
protectingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth tore the crackling paper slowly, her mouth
set in pinched, tense lines which changed suddenly
and quivered for an instant piteously. Then she
regained her composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just a telegram from your brother,&quot; she said
to Elizabeth, &quot;a few lines to inquire about me and
wish me good luck. It&#39;s funny it should have come
<i>now</i>&mdash;isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Crabbing</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth&#39;s first impulse the next morning
was to write to Jean. It was Jean who
always helped her to think out her problems,
and this was the greatest problem that she had ever
been called to face. She could not entirely confide in
her friend, still she was comforted by the mere act
of opening her birthday writing-case, and filling the
fountain pen with which she was going to write.</p>

<p class="indent">She wondered if the Christian Graces, when they
looked down on her Aunt Helen, had ever found her
in such a state of real trouble and dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hope can&#39;t do me much good,&quot; she thought,
&quot;and there is nobody to have any Charity for but
Mr. Piggy Chambers. It&#39;s Faith I need for my
guide, and she is the saddest looking sister of the lot.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jean</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">All I can say is, I wish you were here, and I don&#39;t see how I am
going to stop saying that and write anything else. Letters are
such cold and far-away things. I hope you do know how I love
you, and how the thought of you comforts me. I told you about
Faith, Hope, and Charity. Well, there they stand grinning
above me, and they don&#39;t offer much consolation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span></p>

<p class="indent">I am in trouble, Jean. I can tell you this much. Ruth Farraday
is going to marry Mr. Chambers, and she was Buddy&#39;s
girl. I can&#39;t tell you the ins and outs of it, because they are other
people&#39;s different secrets, but I am afraid that this will kill Buddy,
and I don&#39;t see one single thing to do about it. I feel like a criminal
and a German spy, to tell you even this much, but I feel as
if I should burst with grief&mdash;really burst. You know that feeling
of suffocating you get after you have eaten a lot too much. I
have that same feeling emotionally. I know this is a funny way
to say it, but it&#39;s the only way I can express it. I wish we could
be together, and I could hear you reading poetry or something
soothing, and you could help me think how to break it to Buddy.
It will have to be told him. After I write you, I am going to write
him. So you see how much I value writing to you.</p>

<p class="indent">I will answer your questions some other time, when my mind
is more free. Though I can only doubt if that time will ever
come. I wish you could see Ruth Farraday. There is something
about her that makes me think of the girl in the &quot;First Violin,&quot;
though she isn&#39;t in the least like her. I don&#39;t know what it is.
I guess it is the sadness that hangs about that book. There is a
sadness hanging about her, and about me, too, Jeanie-that-I-love.</p>

<p class="indent">I am glad your friend Neil Seymour is at the Point. I liked him
very much. If he still wants to send me &quot;Prometheus Bound,&quot;
he may, Mother says. I guess she thinks anything that will keep
me contented is a good idea. I think &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;
would help me, if it is anything like what I think it is.</p>

<p class="indent">When I write you, I feel a little as if I were right in the room
with you. What I am doing now is to hang onto the door, not
to have to shut it, and go into another room, where my sick
Buddy is. Life is a strange thing. Good-bye&mdash;good-bye&mdash;good-bye.
I love you&mdash;hard.</p>

<p class="right">That old-fashioned girl,
<span class="smcap">Elspeth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I have got to use my own judgment about writing to you. I
am to blame for writing you the way I did, but I did not know any
better at that time. I only told you the truth. Now I have
more truth to tell you. Buddy, will you brace up as if you were
in the trenches again? You are a soldier, you know, and you&#39;ve
got to fight another battle.</p>

<p class="indent">Mother said I was not to tell you anything that might trouble
you, but I have got to trouble you the worst of all. Buddy, Ruth
Farraday is engaged to marry that goop, and her family have
egged her on till she did not know which way to turn, and has
turned this way. She told me and her family, and her face looked
like death. I am not making this up. Peggy says so, and she
knows. She loves Ruthie with all her heart, and she would not
make anything up. She is not that kind. I am more that kind,
but this is really and truly so. Ruth is not a happy girl, and we
both know it. She has lost her lovely pink cheeks, and is a white
apple blossom now. A pear blossom is more like it, only not
pretty enough for her.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, Buddy, I have never had any real, grown-up trouble,
but the kind of fourteen-year-old trouble I have had has seemed
pretty hard sometimes. Grandmother says that you&#39;ve always
got to live, whether you can or not. I know you don&#39;t want my
condolences, but I love you so that I can&#39;t help being sick over
this. It&#39;s hard work for me to eat and sleep. I hope you can
swear a little, because that will help you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sister</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t feel very much like going to Swan Pond
crabbing,&quot; she thought, as she sealed her two letters,
and set them before her on the desk, &quot;but I suppose
people mustn&#39;t give up to things. Even if my heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
is breaking, the Robbins boy and his cousin and
Peggy ought not to have their plans spoiled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made her way through the chain of little
rooms between her den and her sleeping chamber, unfastening,
as she went, the blue linen gown, buttoned
all the way down the back, that, with its pink twin,
was her regular morning uniform. In her bed room
she slipped into a blouse cut like a boy&#39;s, and dark
blue woollen bloomers with wool stockings to match.
With this she put on, very carefully, a blue tam o&#39; shanter.
She saw in the glass that her face was
drawn, and her eyes had dark shadows beneath them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Tom Robbins notices how I look and asks me
any questions, I shall only tell him that I am in deep
trouble,&quot; she thought. &quot;I won&#39;t say anything like
that to Bill. He would only grin and be embarrassed,
but I think Tom Robbins would understand more
about grief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was a little ashamed of having thought so much
of her own trouble when she saw Peggy&#39;s stricken
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t ask me what has happened,&quot; Peggy whispered,
as they clambered into the car and Grandfather
started for the cross-roads where they were to
pick up the two boys. &quot;I don&#39;t know what hasn&#39;t
happened. Ruth has shut herself into her room,
after some sort of a tragic heart-to-heart talk with
Father, and Mother and Father are scarcely speaking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
and the cook is mad, and ruined the breakfast
muffins and gave us bad eggs, or baddish eggs, for
breakfast, and Sister won&#39;t see me. Piggy sent her
a huge box of flowers this morning. I&#39;ve got to stop
calling him Piggy and call him Albert, I suppose.
Wouldn&#39;t you know his name would be Albert? Isn&#39;t
he the most Albertish person? Elizabeth, I never
hated anybody so much in all my life. He never did
me any harm, but I would be pleased and proud to&mdash;to
choke him to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So would I,&quot; sighed Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wasn&#39;t it funny, her getting that telegram from
your brother just when she did? Sometimes I think
she was keen on your brother, and sort of peeved because
he didn&#39;t ever write to her when he got back.
You don&#39;t suppose she&#39;d get herself engaged to Piggy
just out of pride, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Elizabeth cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow, she took that telegram to bed with her,
and it was all mussed up under her pillow. I know,
because I made the beds this morning. Our treasure
of a second maid went to mass, and stayed out to
breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s all that whispering about?&quot; Grandfather
inquired, looking over his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve a great
mind to just reach over and tech the whip to you,&quot;
he made a movement toward an invisible whip
socket. &quot;I guess I won&#39;t. It makes Lizzie nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
to have me flourishing a whip around. I suppose
you are trying to get all giggled and whispered up
before you have to stop it and talk to the boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We aren&#39;t giggling much this morning,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;There they are on the corner, waving
to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever see such red hair?&quot; Peggy said. &quot;I
like red-headed children and boys. I don&#39;t think I
like red-headed girls so much. I think Mabel is awfully
cunning with her red curls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mabel? Oh, she has real auburn hair,&quot; Elizabeth
said, &quot;and it&#39;s beautiful. How do you do?&quot; she
returned Tom Robbins&#39; greeting with more than a
touch of her customary shyness as he scrambled for
a place on the floor of the car at her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s my turn,&quot; he insisted, as his friend Bill tried
to argue the matter. &quot;You ride with Captain
Swift, and mind the rakes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got real nets!&quot; Peggy cried. &quot;How
scrumptious! We just take rakes, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know as the Swan Pond crabs will consent
to do anything but be raked in,&quot; Grandfather said.
&quot;I heard of a boy once that caught a crab in one of
those store nets, but it was a bad one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wait and see,&quot; Tom said. &quot;Our object is to
catch crabs, and we are going to catch them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So am I,&quot; said Grandfather.</p>

<p class="indent">They left the machine in a clearing by the roadside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
and, laden with nets and bait, made their way
through a path among the underbrush, until they
stood on the shore of Swan Lake. A blue sky, with
here and there a winging cloud, met the low horizon,
skirted with the dense green of low-set pine and oak
trees. The gray-green water lapped the shore
alluringly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a general scramble to remove encumbering
shoes and stockings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If anybody says, &#39;Come on in, the water&#39;s fine,&#39;
they&#39;ll owe me a pineapple college ice,&quot; Peggy
declared, &quot;or, if you prefer it in New York-ese, a
pineapple sundae&mdash;though why they should think
over there that by spelling Sunday with an e, they
can make it a soda-fountain dish, I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you go jeering at the manners and customs
of my native town,&quot; Elizabeth cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did your ancestors own most of New York?&quot;
Grandfather asked, innocently. &quot;I thought most of
Manhattan Island belonged to the Dutch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what my ancestors owned,&quot;
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They owned this, for instance,&quot; her grandfather
waved a nonchalant hand at the beautiful country
about him, &quot;forty or fifty acres around these parts.
My Great-grandfather Swift, he got kinder tired of
having so much property, and he sold a chunk to the
town for a cemetery, and one thing and another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
&quot;Where did he live?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Up the road apiece, in a great house that was
burnt down long before my time. He was quite a
likely old fellow, though, from all I can hear of him.
He had a lot of stories told about him. He started a
bank, and all his money was carted up to it in ox
teams, because they didn&#39;t have anything but silver
money in those days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite an influential old party, wasn&#39;t he?&quot;
Peggy said. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it make you feel creepy,
Elizabeth, to descend from the very oldest settlers,
the way you do? I don&#39;t know anything about my
ancestors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never did before,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The time is going to come when Elizabeth will be
proud of what she comes from,&quot; her grandfather said.
&quot;Well, if anybody really wants to go crabbing with
me, I&#39;d advise them to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in while the water&#39;s fine,&quot; the boys chanted
together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I owe you a pineapple college ice,&quot; Bill grinned at
Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I owe you a pineapple sundae,&quot; Tom told Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t betting,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I was,&quot; Tom&#39;s grin was almost as broad as
his cousin&#39;s. &quot;You can have a maple marshmallow
sundae if you prefer it. I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
&quot;Well, it&#39;s hard to choose,&quot; Elizabeth temporized.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can have both,&quot; Tom decided. &quot;I&#39;ll show
you how to use the crab catcher. You float the bait
on this line, and when the crab comes to the surface,
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Grandfather, scorning artificial allurements,
caught the first crab. The crab was scurrying away
over the pebbles and shells at the bottom of the
transparent water when Grandfather&#39;s inexorable
implement caught him in mid-career, and he was
imprisoned in the covered basket they had brought
for the purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know that you could catch them so near
the shore,&quot; Elizabeth said, looking down at her bare
toes in some dismay, &quot;do they hurt when they bite
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The game is not to let them bite you,&quot; Peggy
said. &quot;Hooray! One for me&mdash;us, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three,&quot; said Grandfather, landing another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got the father and mother of all crabs here,&quot;
Bill Dean said, as he dragged at the handle of his net.
&quot;Look at old Grandfather Crab.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He isn&#39;t very pretty,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but I prefer
him to a raw lobster. I never saw a green lobster
till the other day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was just making Judidy throw it out when
I caught her at it,&quot; Grandfather laughed, &quot;she said it
was sick, and would give us all ptomaine poisoning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
and the lobster was so mad when he heard it that he
tried to claw poor Judidy&#39;s hand off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>is</i> strange that they turn bright red after being
bright green,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I think I prefer
crabs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come with me, and we&#39;ll get some,&quot; Tom said,
taking possession of her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess we can rest now,&quot; he said a little later, &quot;we
got more than any of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we got as many, anyhow. I&#39;m hot, aren&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth mopped her forehead and smiled by way
of answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; Tom said, &quot;there is something I want
to ask you, Miss Swift. If you don&#39;t like it you just
have to say so, and I will understand and not ask you
again. I was just wondering if I couldn&#39;t call you
Elizabeth. Bill he&#39;s going to ask Peggy, I mean Miss
Farraday, the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know you had been calling me anything,&quot;
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t. I think last names are rather
stiff, you know, and I didn&#39;t like to use your first
name without permission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d just as soon have you call me by my first
name,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;if&mdash;if only&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got something in your mind about me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
that you aren&#39;t saying. If you think it&#39;s&mdash;well&mdash;fresh&mdash;of
me, to ask you that question about first
names, you can say so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fresh of you,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;but I&mdash;well, I don&#39;t feel like talking in any way but
a very straightforward and truthful way to-day. The
thing I don&#39;t like, really, is the way you tried to get
acquainted with us. Every time I think of that, I
feel as if&mdash;well, I wish it hadn&#39;t happened, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I,&quot; said Tom Robbins, soberly, &quot;but I&#39;ll
tell you something. I have never done anything like
that before. We just made up our minds that we
would, that&#39;s all. You know the way you make up
your mind to try something that you&#39;ve seen other
people do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t see why you tried it on us,&quot; said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see why we did, either, except that we
wanted to know you the most of any girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like to have a boy make me feel that he
thinks I am a girl he can scrape acquaintance with,&quot;
Elizabeth said. &quot;It hurts my feelings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t hurt your feelings for anything, and
you ought to know now that I am not the kind of boy
that does things like that, except for a lark. Don&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t I what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Know that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
&quot;Yes, I guess I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, you can call me Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy and I have caught more than you have,&quot;
Bill shouted, as he came up with crawling crabs in
his net.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it worked all right,&quot; Tom whispered to
Elizabeth, &quot;with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bill asked if he could call me Peggy,&quot; that young
lady whispered to Elizabeth, on the way home. &quot;I
was so surprised I nearly fell over. I thought he
always had. I&#39;ve always called him Bill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think boys sort of make up their minds to do a
certain kind of thing, and then they do it,&quot; said
Elizabeth, &quot;without thinking whether it is really
appropriate or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you are right,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;and now
that we&#39;ve had this pleasant afternoon, we&#39;ll just
have to take up the burden of our gloomy thoughts
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it,&quot; said Elizabeth, forlornly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Is Rude</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth and Moses took the shore road,
and finally struck off across the fields and
through the woods to make a short cut for
the bathing beach. Moses was going to initiate
the new bathing suit Elizabeth had bought him,
and Elizabeth to sit on the beach and knit on a
sweater she was making for Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a rehabilitated Moses that alternately
darted and jogged along by her side. He was wearing
one of the half-dozen shirts that Grandmother
had cut and made by the famous Butterick pattern
from which the girls had fashioned the garment he
wore on his appearance at the bean supper. His
trousers were the veritable &quot;pants&quot; of his dreams,
and the rudiments of suspenders, with which he
would not part, were tucked in under his belt. His
face was comparatively clean, and he had allowed
Elizabeth to brush his heavy, upstanding hair until
it looked almost personable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are those things around your neck?&quot;
Elizabeth cried, catching sight of an extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
decoration only partially concealed by his shirt
collar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shark&#39;s teeth. I wear &#39;em for luck. I cut &#39;em
out myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cut them out of what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sharks. What&#39;d you think I got &#39;em from?
Cats or something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Moses, you&#39;ve got to learn to be a little more respectful
to me. I don&#39;t like the way you speak to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; he agreed, amiably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you get those teeth from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you I got &#39;em from sharks. I go down to
the shore when the boats come in from their weir.
You know, the men bring in a lot of fish every day.
Well, yesterday they brought in four sharks and they
let me cut out these teeth. I could of got more if my
knife had been sharper, or I&#39;d had more time. Every
night they give me a fish, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound a bit probable, about the
sharks. Still, I never caught you telling a lie, Moses.
What do you do with the fish they give you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I take &#39;em home and I cook &#39;em. Mis&#39; Laury
Ann, she showed me how, one time. Mabel, I&#39;m
learning her to cook, and Madget she wants I should
learn her, but I don&#39;t think I shall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve rather neglected you
lately,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I haven&#39;t been to see
your mother for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
&quot;Well, Mis&#39; Laury Ann she comes, and Judidy.
Mother says neglecting is all you can expect from
girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s a whole lot better, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Elizabeth
asked, hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure. Mis&#39; Abithy Hawes she come around and
got Little Eva to going it, and Little Eva she said
that Mother had water on her lungs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Mother she got to reading a book that said
housework was a good cure for sickness. About
sweeping bein&#39; good for the spine, and washing bein&#39;
good for the stomick, and housecleaning a good thing
for the figger. So she thought she&#39;d try that, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did she get the book?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was one that Mis&#39; Laury Ann lent her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess Grandmother is working along the way
she said she was going to,&quot; Elizabeth thought.
&quot;Does your mother really do housework?&quot; she asked,
aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most every day,&quot; Moses said, proudly, &quot;she
bought me these pants, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she do any cooking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She don&#39;t like to cook, and she ain&#39;t never learned.
I kin learn her when I&#39;ve learned myself some more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does seem as if there were <i>some</i> improvement
in your family&#39;s condition, doesn&#39;t it, Moses?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Judidy, she told Ma she was the town&#39;s poor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
and Ma says she ain&#39;t. That kind of stuck in Ma&#39;s
crop, and Madget cried and said she wouldn&#39;t go to
the poor house. Now Ma says she is going to buy
tea and coffee enough to git a premium set o&#39; dishes.
I don&#39;t know whether she will or not. If she don&#39;t
I&#39;m going to earn them. Captain Swift is going to let
me sell some corn and string beans out of his garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The path emerged on the beach, and Moses disappeared
abruptly in the direction of his favourite
clump of pines, scorning a bath-house. He reappeared
almost immediately, clad in a single garment
of blue jersey that glistened with newness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You watch me pretending to be a whale,&quot; he
said, &quot;first I&#39;ll dive. Then I&#39;ll come up spouting
a whole mouthful of water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a good little swimmer,&quot; Elizabeth thought,
as she watched his antics. &quot;I guess he&#39;ll turn out
all right. How wonderful Grandmother is, always
keeping her eye on them. It&#39;s so much easier to do
a thing like that as hard as you can sometimes, and
then drop it, than it is to keep pegging along at it all
the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was knitting so busily that she did not see
Ruth Farraday approaching along the beach, and
it was not until a long shadow fell across her work
that she realized Ruth was near. Ruth in a pink
voile frock, with a frilly, rose-coloured parasol,
smiled down at her&mdash;a smile of the lips only.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
&quot;Shall I sit down beside you?&quot; she asked, in her
low, clear voice. &quot;Peggy couldn&#39;t come down to the
beach to-day. I was too lazy to go in swimming,
but I thought I&#39;d like a smell of the sea, all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&#39;m very glad to see you,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you. I haven&#39;t seen you since
that other day at tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Elizabeth, gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t been feeling very well since then. It
was&mdash;nice of your brother to wire me, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told Buddy that I thought you would be pleased
to hear from him. It was my fault. I shouldn&#39;t
have told him, if I had known.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you had known what?&quot; asked Ruth Farraday,
lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you were going to marry somebody else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somebody else?&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somebody that wasn&#39;t Buddy,&quot; Elizabeth said,
bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There never was any question of my marrying
your brother. We were very good friends before
he went abroad. Then he seemed to let it&mdash;our
friendship, die a natural death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you about his being sick,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and I told you that there weren&#39;t any other girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There not being any other girls doesn&#39;t&mdash;didn&#39;t
necessarily mean&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, it does, with Buddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
&quot;That&#39;s putting it rather ambiguously.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s putting it,&quot; Elizabeth cried,
&quot;but I do know that there wasn&#39;t any other girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t tell you so, did he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Elizabeth stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you said that you told him to communicate
with me?&quot; Ruth was having almost as much difficulty
in speaking as Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wrote and asked my advice, and I told him
I would, if I were he, and that was why he did it,
and then I had to write him that you were engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve written him that already?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to,&quot; Elizabeth said, miserably. &quot;I had
just told him that you weren&#39;t engaged to anybody
else, and that you inquired about him, and that you&mdash;you
might want to hear from him. He&#39;s very sick,
and he wrote and asked me what to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When did he write that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just the other day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you wrote just the other day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was time for him to get my letter before
he telegraphed to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then you wrote again to say that I was
engaged?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m still engaged,&quot; Ruth Farraday said,
lightly. &quot;When you write to him, won&#39;t you tell
him that I thank him for remembering me so&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
pleasantly, but that I&#39;m a good deal occupied just
at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I won&#39;t,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s too sick, and it would bother him too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said Ruth Farraday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to be rude,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were, rather. I&#39;d like to send your brother
a message, you see, and I&mdash;I can&#39;t write to him.
I&#39;ve tried, and I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t want him to think
I am altogether unappreciative. What message
shall I send him, Elizabeth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send him your love, if you really mean it, and
then not any message.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will. I do send him my love. I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s
sick. Wouldn&#39;t it be wise to say that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send him my love and tell him&mdash;oh, tell him he
was a day too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">With one long, indrawn breath, Ruth Farraday
turned and walked back along the beach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s shivering as if she were cold,&quot; Elizabeth
thought, as she watched the diminishing figure.</p>

<p class="indent">It was high tide, and the deep blue waves were
foam-crested. The wide sky was streaked with
clouds, and a bright sun lay hot upon the sands.
Elizabeth looked first at Moses&#39; bobbing head, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
then at the bobbing, rose-coloured parasol dwindling
in the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life is a curious thing,&quot; she said to herself, slowly,
&quot;it keeps changing so, getting better or worse all
the time. Here&#39;s Moses and the Steppes, who were
so perfectly hopeless and helpless, and there is an
improvement in them. They are my friends and
my responsibility&mdash;if I don&#39;t live up to it very well.
Then here is Ruth Farraday, that I truly love, and
everything about her is getting worse every minute,
and it&#39;s all mixed up with me, somehow. I don&#39;t
do much good, or anything, but it&#39;s mixed up with
me all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knitted to the end of her row and pulled out
her needle. She gave another long look at sea and sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything is a part of everything,&quot; she said,
a little confusedly. &quot;Poor Buddy, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She wrote him a long letter that night, and told
him what Ruth had said, and then she tried not to
think about him at all for the next few days. She
was afraid for what she had done. She had had no
word from him in answer to her letter announcing
Ruth&#39;s engagement, and only the briefest line from
her mother, who was evidently gravely anxious about
her son&#39;s condition. She knew that Buddy was
worse, and she knew that the letter she had written
him had made him worse; how much worse, Elizabeth
could not bear to think.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
It was five days after her meeting with Ruth upon
the beach that the evening mail brought her two
letters, one in her mother&#39;s handwriting and one in
Buddy&#39;s. Judidy brought them in and put them in
her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going to lose Judidy next winter,&quot; her
grandmother said when that young woman had
blushed, giggled, and withdrawn to the back porch,
from which the sound of a drawling, masculine voice
was heard at intervals, interspersed with Judidy&#39;s
high-pitched protestations. &quot;She&#39;s going to be
married, she tells me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she?&quot; said Elizabeth, trying to subdue the
dizziness she felt at the sight of Buddy&#39;s familiar
scrawl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandfather and I thought we&#39;d give them a
wedding. Judidy&#39;s folks won&#39;t. They are nice
enough people, but peculiar&mdash;odd. They believe
in saving trouble and expense on everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Grandmother,&quot; Elizabeth said, trembling,
&quot;will you hold my hand while I read these letters?
I&mdash;I am so worried about Buddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certain.&quot; Grandmother drew out the little footstool
that matched the particular valanced rocker
she was sitting in. &quot;You come here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth leaned her head against her grandmother&#39;s
knee, with the feeling of faintness still upon
her. Her grandmother stroked her hair gently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
&quot;I can&#39;t read them out loud, Grandma. They are
private in a way. It&#39;s&mdash;it&#39;s the private things in
them that frighten me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ain&#39;t nothing in this world to be afraid of.
There ain&#39;t,&quot; said Grandmother. &quot;Fear once killed
a cat, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you ever get afraid, Grandma?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certain I get afraid, but when I do, I just think
that there ain&#39;t nothing in this world to be afraid of
so much as of being afraid, and that kind of stops
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t help being afraid of what&#39;s in this particular
letter.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 454px;">

letter&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you afraid it&#39;s going to do to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you just open it up and read it, and after
you&#39;ve opened it up, you&#39;ll just find you&#39;re sitting
here the way you were before, with your grandma&#39;s
arms around you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth pulled the kindly hand down to meet
her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m going to read it now.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Little Sister</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I can&#39;t tell you how much I thank you for your two letters.
They cured me. I&#39;ve been seeing ghosts, but &quot;being gone, I am a
man again.&quot; I&#39;m going to get my discharge if I have to bust
the whole darned hospital, and I&#39;m coming down to Cape Cod.
While there, I shall tell you what I think of several things, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
the opinion I have of a man who sits in a cloud of vapour
all day in a United States Base Hospital, and lets things go some
other man&#39;s way.</p>

<p class="indent">You tell Miss Ruth Farraday that it&#39;s never too late. No,
don&#39;t tell her anything, but whenever you see the man in the case,
stick out your sweet little tongue at him. I&#39;m sick&mdash;sure I&#39;m
sick, but I&#39;m a well man, just the same. You wait and see. I
broke the news to Mother and she doesn&#39;t believe it. She thinks
that I&#39;m probably delirious. Father sees that something significant
has happened, but doesn&#39;t believe that I can bust out so
easy. You wait, dear.</p>

<p class="indent">Keep your eye on Ruth and report to me.</p>

<p class="indent">I love and admire you, and you are my own darling sister,
for whom and which I devoutly thank whatever gods there be.
I am the Captain of my Soul.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Your Buddy.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth buried her face in the ample folds of
her grandmother&#39;s white apron.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to get well,&quot; she sobbed.
&quot;Oh, dear, I was afraid I had killed him, but I didn&#39;t.
I did him good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He needed something to rouse him,&quot; Grandmother
said, &quot;your mother says the doctor has
been saying that for some time. I don&#39;t know how
you&#39;ve done it, but I guess you&#39;ve turned the
trick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says he&#39;s going to get out and come down here
right away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought &#39;twas about time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;He&#39;s so sweet and dear and handsome, and he
was so brave, and oh, I love him so!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That don&#39;t seem to me to be anything to sob
over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I can&#39;t help it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always cried more tears of joy than I ever cried
of sorrow. It runs in the family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I can read Mother&#39;s letter aloud. It&#39;s
longer than Buddy&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">The strangest thing has happened to your brother. He has
suddenly taken a new lease of life. Night before last I left him
just as dull and discouraged and apathetic as ever, and this morning
when I went to see him, at about ten o&#39;clock, he was another
boy. The nurse said he had been that way ever since he got a
letter from you in the morning mail. I suppose that was merely
a coincidence. I don&#39;t mean to say that I found him in any
seraphic mood. He was literally fighting mad at the hospital
authorities, and his whole mind seemed concentrated on getting
out. At first I thought his fever had risen, but the doctor assures
me that the subtle cloud that has been resting over his mind has
lifted. He says he has never known a case where the patient provided
his own stimulus before, that usually it has come from the
outside in the form of some kind of shock, pleasant or unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">It hasn&#39;t been entirely a nervous case, you understand. He
would probably have less trouble in getting away, if it had been
just a matter of mind, but his mind has kept his body sick. It&#39;s
been a vicious circle. He has believed, it now develops, that the
physical matter was incurable. His old job was gone, you know,
and that seemed to depress him. Your father was perfectly
willing to keep him at home indefinitely, and we kept telling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
him so, but in his poor, tortured mind he had construed our doing
so into an admission that we never expected him to get well.</p>

<p class="indent">At any rate, the worst is over now. I believe we&#39;ll have our
boy restored in mind and body very soon. I don&#39;t dare to hope
we&#39;ll all get down to Cape Cod as soon as he thinks we shall
but I am inclined to think that he is too lively a character for the
United States Government to hold very much longer.</p>

<p class="indent">You have been my brave, darling daughter, and I love you
more than I can tell you. I am sending your shoes by this post.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mother.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he&#39;ll get here while it&#39;s still cucumber
season,&quot; Grandmother said. &quot;My, how that boy
used to eat herrings and cucumbers! I cooked a
whole half dozen once, and I vow he et the whole
lot, and I don&#39;t know how many cucumbers. He was
a dretful one to eat. He used to like to climb up
in the pear tree in pear season, and pick the topmost
pear on the tree and eat his way down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mind if I cry a little more, Grandma?
I can stop, but I don&#39;t want to,&quot; Elizabeth sniffled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be good for the fern to have a little dampness
in the air. You cry, and I&#39;ll knit a spell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You tease just about as much as Grandfather
does, don&#39;t&mdash;don&#39;t you? Only you&#39;re so&mdash;so sly
about it, nobody realizes it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ain&#39;t that our ring on the telephone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. I just sit here and let it ring all
the time. I forget to count whether it&#39;s fifteen or
fourteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;Land, fourteen will wake me up out of a sound
sleep when I&#39;m to bed upstairs. And I don&#39;t never
hear fifteen no more&#39;n if it hadn&#39;t sounded.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It <i>is</i> fourteen,&quot; Elizabeth said, as the imperious
instrument sounded one long and four short signals
distinctly. &quot;I&#39;ll answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth, where have you been all day?&quot;
Peggy&#39;s voice inquired. &quot;I particularly want to see
you about something, but Mother insists it&#39;s too late
for me to come over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went swimming with Moses,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and finished Madget&#39;s sweater, and made a chocolate
cake. What is it that you&#39;ve got to tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t tell you very well over the phone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it pleasant or unpleasant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unpleasant,&quot; Peggy whispered, with her mouth
close to the receiver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hint it. Is it about Ruthie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it&#39;s unpleasant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there is something pleasant about it. The
festivities will be pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Peggy, tell me. I&#39;ve just about got to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, listen close. It&#39;s going to be hurried up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The&mdash;well&mdash;you know. Somebody&#39;s receiver is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
down. They are listening in. Don&#39;t you hear
that clock ticking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t mind that. Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ve hung up, I think. Guess what I mean.
The festivities are going to be hurried up. We want
you to take part in them. It&#39;s going to be in two
weeks. Now do you know? It begins with w.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean Ruth is going to be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but don&#39;t breathe it. We want you at it&mdash;you
know&mdash;the w. You and me, dressed alike in
blue dimity. There won&#39;t be many people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Peggy, I couldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you can. The way I look at it is that we
might as well be philosophical about it and have a
good time, even if our hearts do hang down to our
boots. Don&#39;t you say so? Mother is calling me
and I&#39;ve got to go. Don&#39;t breathe a word. I&#39;ll
tell you all about it to-morrow. I&#39;ll be over. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, good-bye!&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Picking Chickens</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want to come out and set with me in
the woodshed while I pick a couple o&#39;
chicken?&quot; Grandfather asked one morning
at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&mdash;es,&quot; said his granddaughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t mind picking a chicken, but I do like
encouragement while I&#39;m a-doing of it. All the pesky
little pin feathers stick twice as tight when I&#39;m
alone with &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When do you begin?&quot; Elizabeth faltered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Soon&#39;s I can get to it. First I catch my chickens.
After you have heard them squawking for a while,
you get your knitting and come out to the shed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When he cuts off their heads, I just about pass
into Kingdom Come,&quot; said Judidy. &quot;I hate to hear
them squawking as much as I hate to hear a pig
stuck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do you cut off their heads?&quot; Elizabeth asked,
faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I wring their necks first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t take Jehoshaphat, will you, Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Swift? I&#39;ve fed him about every day this year,
and he eats out o&#39; my hand just as cute&#39;s the next
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t take Speckletop, will you, Grandfather?&quot;
Elizabeth moaned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s a setting hen. I don&#39;t calculate to eat no
chicken pie made out o&#39; setting hens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s dretful hard to eat your own hens,&quot; Grandmother
said. &quot;You raise &#39;em from chickens, and you
get to know every one from every t&#39;other one, and
then some fine morning Father he puts their heads
on the chopping block, and that&#39;s the last of them,
but they do stick, going down, when I try to eat
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry, Mother. I know this
is a pretty middling tender-hearted family, so I
bought this pair o&#39; roosters over to Battletown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s Battletown?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the old-fashioned name for the region over
yonder. This here was called Crocker Neck. You
remind me and I&#39;ll tell you some poetry about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate to eat anybody else&#39;s hens,&quot; Grandmother
said, &quot;you don&#39;t know how they been raised.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They say old Uncle Jonathan Swift won&#39;t take
his vittles hot nor cold,&quot; Grandfather chuckled.
&quot;Either way they hurt his teeth, he says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you feel too squeamish about seeing those
chickens picked, you just tell Grandfather, Elizabeth,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
her grandmother said after he had left the
table. &quot;I used to feel pretty delicate about such
things myself, till I decided I&#39;d got to get hardened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you get hardened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I took a spell to think about it. I can
stand most anything if I can get my ideas fixed up
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, so can I,&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;I guess I inherited
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t stand the sight o&#39; blood, or hearing
about killing a pig or a chicken, much less seeing
the carcasses around. Well, I come to the conclusion
that every time a chicken was killed somebody&#39;d
have to pick it, and I could pick a chicken if anybody
else could. I figured out that if it wasn&#39;t me, it
would have to be somebody else, probably just as
squeamish. So I went ahead and caught a chicken
and wrung its neck. I couldn&#39;t of chopped off its head
if I suffered, but after Father helped me out that far,
I cleaned it and picked it just like a storekeeper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that&#39;s the way you do get character,
just by doing things that you can&#39;t do&mdash;all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Providence sees that you have plenty of
things to do that can&#39;t be done. I kinder hate to
see young folks forcing themselves into it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I&#39;ll go and see that chicken picked all the
same, Grandmother,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not even put her fingers in her ears to shut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
out the sounds of attack and slaughter in the chicken
yard when she went out to the woodshed and took
her place determinedly on the step, companionably
near the three-legged stool that her grandfather had
drawn up to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was the poetry you said you were going to
say to me?&quot; she began, &quot;that poetry about Crocker
Neck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just what the girls used to say to the boys
when they went a-courting:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Hasty pudding in the pot,</span>
<span class="i0">Pumpkin in the lantern,</span>
<span class="i0">If you hadn&#39;t come from Crocker Neck,</span>
<span class="i0">You wouldn&#39;t be so handsome.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t rhyme very well, does it?&quot; Elizabeth
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It used to kinder tickle the young folks. We
used to have one that we said to the girls:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The Cape Cod girls they have no combs.</span>
<span class="i0">They comb their hair with the codfish bones.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I don&#39;t know as that rhymes any better, but
young folks get up things that don&#39;t have much
rhyme or reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The air was full of the scent of wet feathers.
Elizabeth looked up in time to see him lift a dripping
fowl from the pail of hot water at his side, and then
hastily looked away again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
&quot;Grandfather, what did you do when you were a
young man?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went to sea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old were you when you first went?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Long about nine or ten. I started in by going
cook.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cook?&quot; Elizabeth cried. &quot;Cook? How&mdash;how
did that happen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the boys went cook summers. We used to
go to district school in the winter and then go to sea
in the summer. I cooked for seventeen men my
first trip, and I hadn&#39;t nothing to cook in but a baking
kettle, neither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of boat did you go in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather industriously plucked at the carcass
in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A fishing vessel. She was called the <i>Good Intent</i>.
I used to make seven loaves of bread at a time,
and we had to eat it every scrap up before we could
touch the new. It didn&#39;t make much difference,
though, because we carried four bushels of meal,
part Indian and part rye, and it all soured before we
was out long, but we et it just the same. We used
to stay out two or three weeks at a time, and bring
in seven or eight thousand fish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t believe that you used to be a cook. It
doesn&#39;t seem possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t used to be a cook,&quot; said Grandfather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
quietly, &quot;I used to go cook on my grandfather&#39;s
vessel. Have you heard from that friend of yours
lately whose brother-in-law is a count?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Yes, that is. She writes me quite regularly.&quot;
Elizabeth blushed crimson. &quot;She&#39;s an awfully nice
girl, with no nonsense about her at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Taint so much her that I&#39;m interested in as her
brother-in-law,&quot; Grandfather said, solemnly, &quot;he
must have been a pretty smart man, to earn that
title of count by his own efforts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I don&#39;t think he did,&quot; Elizabeth said, before
she caught the twinkle in her grandfather&#39;s eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your grandmother&#39;s father he was a sailmaker,
you know,&quot; he continued, soberly. &quot;He used to
have a sail loft where he sat and sewed on sails.
He used to pay your grandmother by the dozen
for threading for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; said Elizabeth. She looked
up from her knitting for an instant, and saw the
strange, prickly surface of the denuded fowl. &quot;I
didn&#39;t realize that the reason they called it goose
flesh when they got chilled was because your flesh
looked like a goose&#39;s flesh&mdash;I mean a&mdash;a geese&#39;s,&quot; she
added, hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and sometimes the reason they call a young
girl a little goose is that all of a sudden she begins
to act like one. Pesky things, these little pin
feathers!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
&quot;I&mdash;I can help you do that,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, put that towel over your lap and don&#39;t get
any blood on you. Sure it won&#39;t make you sick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m just about sure that it will,&quot; said Elizabeth,
&quot;but&mdash;but what do I care? Did it make you sick
when you first went to sea, Grandfather?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sick as a dog,&quot; said her grandfather, heartily,
&quot;and the smell of that souring meal, and mouldy corn
beef, and dead fish&mdash;well, I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you poor, poor granddaddy,&quot; Elizabeth cried,
&quot;you poor little boy, why did they make you go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was my father&#39;s idea of bringing me up. I
ain&#39;t so sure it wasn&#39;t a pretty good one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you get paid for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Six dollars a month and found. I had the promise
of a new hat in the fall, but I never saw it. Times
has changed considerable since I was a boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think they had,&quot; said Elizabeth, fervently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, Grandfather he owned a fleet of fishing
vessels, he owned a dozen himself, and he was part
owner with your grandmother&#39;s father in as many
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought you said Grandmother&#39;s father
was a&mdash;was just a sailmaker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he was, but he was a shipowner, too. He had
to have an interest in a good many vessels in order
to get the business of making sails for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he make them all by himself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
Grandfather smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, not exactly. His will was good, but he
couldn&#39;t manage to fit out more than a few hundred
boats single-handed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You laugh at me every word you say, Grandfather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About every other word, I should call it. He
went to sea a good part of his life, but he had learned
his trade at sailmaking. Boys learned a trade those
days, if they was real enterprising. My father he
learned the cooper&#39;s trade when he was a boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How big were these boats?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They carried from ten to twenty-five men.
Grandfather he built a sailing vessel down here at
the mouth of Herring River that went all around
the world nearabout. &#39;Twas his boast that he built
it from timber cut on his own land. I was on board
of her just off New Bedford when the steamer
<i>Morning Star</i> struck her amidships. She sunk in
less&#39;n fifteen minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&mdash;were saved?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I woke up when she struck, and I come up from
below just as I was, in my underclothes. I saw a
dark shape coming alongside, and that was all I
knew. I jumped for her. They said I was the first
one over the side. &#39;Twas the old coastwise steamer
that saved us, nosing along in the dark. She was
good enough for me to land on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;All these things don&#39;t seem possible, Grandfather.
I can&#39;t believe them. You must have been a brave
little boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think boys is born brave,
but they get the fear o&#39; God put into them one way
or another, the same as little girls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But all these things are like&mdash;story books.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like enough. Story books is imitated from real
life, as near as I can make out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t think any things like these could happen
to anybody I knew. I mean, things so exciting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never thought to sink so low as to be picking
pin feathers out of the same fowl with a feller that
had been cook on a fishing schooner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time Elizabeth met his twinkling gaze. She
rose from her task long enough to deposit an emphatic
kiss on the top of a shiny, bald pate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who called me a goose?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the circles you&#39;re accustomed to, I suppose
they don&#39;t call such names?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is the circle in which I move,&quot; Elizabeth
said, &quot;this circle of you and Grandmother and Judidy.
Now I know where I inherited my cooking ability
from&mdash;you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there was times when the crew could get
their teeth into my pie crust,&quot; grandfather admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth slipped up to her room that afternoon,
after her noonday dinner, and wrote to Jean:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeanie Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I have learned so much since I came to Cape Cod, that I don&#39;t
see how there is going to be much more in the world to learn. I
suppose there will be, but I don&#39;t think it can possibly be so
important. I was an untried child when I came here, and now
look at me. You can&#39;t, but I wish you could. I have grown
a little taller and, I think, a lot sadder looking. Also, I am
healthier. I feel a lot like Alice in Wonderland, mentally, however&mdash;I
have to keep running and running, to stay in the same
place, and then I don&#39;t.</p>

<p class="indent">I have some things in my mind that I can hardly bear, and
some that I can hardly wait for, and some that I can hardly believe.
You know what they are all about. The first is Buddy&#39;s
girl and her approaching wedding. I am to stand up with them.
I couldn&#39;t refuse; how could I, Jean? It&#39;s just a terrible, terrible
thing. Buddy doesn&#39;t know it, because he is coming out of the
hospital and down here just as soon as he can, and I am afraid
it would retard his recovery if I wrote him. So I am not telling
him till he gets here. Do you wonder, Jean, that I feel like a so
much older girl than I did when I first came down here? Sometimes
I think that my hair ought to be quite gray, with all my
responsibility. I lit a light once, in the middle of the night, and
got up to see if I hadn&#39;t really got gray hair, I felt so gray. I
keep having to decide what to tell Buddy and what not. I
can&#39;t ask Mother, because Buddy would never forgive me if I
did, and what he would do to me would turn me gray for a fact,
I guess. I&#39;ve hinted it all out to you to keep from bursting, but
Jeanie, it isn&#39;t the same thing as talking to you. It&#39;s only like
saying my prayers or writing a diary. Besides, I haven&#39;t told
you details. Only the general facts.</p>

<p class="indent">The things I can hardly wait for are my parents and Buddy
coming&mdash;my own brother, that has come out of the jaws of death
in two senses, since I have seen him. Once from the Trenches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
and once from the U. S. Base Hospital. Having a brother is
the strangest, sweetest thing. I&#39;d rather have one than a sister,
though I do think Ruth Farraday is beautiful, and Peggy&#39;s lot is,
next to mine, the most fortunate in that respect. I ought not
to crow like this to an only child, though.</p>

<p class="indent">The things I can hardly believe are the things I&#39;ve been hearing
about my ancestors. In a way, you know, I think it is more interesting
to be an American than even to be a count. I&#39;ve
lived along all my life with the idea that I was a New Yorker,
or rather a New Jerseyite with one foot on Broadway or Fifth
Avenue, and I thought the cook was the cook and the butcher
the butcher, and that was all there was to it. I had a grandfather
and grandmother that I had idealized in my imagination, all
dressed up in city clothes and manners. I didn&#39;t stop to think
what I came from, except that Mother was an Endicott, and that
all her relations lived abroad most of the time.</p>

<p class="indent">You know the rude shock I got when I came down here. The
corner grocer is my distant uncle. The hired girl is a kind of
cousin. The butcher that goes out selling things in a cart, meat
all raw and pig pork that he has killed himself, is the family&#39;s
friend. It seemed just plain awful to me at first. I didn&#39;t know
what any of it <i>meant</i>. But now I&#39;m getting to. I talked with
grandfather, who quite rightly understands my horrid scruples
and teases me to pieces about them, and I talked with Peggy,
whose father tells her a lot of things. (Those girls get their
niceness from their father.)</p>

<p class="indent">He says this early settlers&#39; blood is a wonderful thing. It was
mostly the younger sons of aristocrat families that settled here,
and a great many of them married their cooks or serving maids.
(Perhaps that&#39;s why cooking is such a general talent.) They had
to hew a living out of a very sterile soil, and to learn all the virtues
of thrift and prudence from actual practise. They didn&#39;t
have any houses or money or matches or anything. They just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
had to make them, and learn not to be aristocrats, instead of
learning to be. They had to <i>make</i> New England. Well, my
grandparents and my great-great-great-greats did an awful lot
about this. There wouldn&#39;t be any Cape Cod, if it hadn&#39;t been
for these Industries that they were engaged in, and it&#39;s the most
romantic thing, the way even young children lived this seagoing,
hardy life in the school of hard knocks. My grandfather was a
cook at a very early age, and was lost at sea, only he jumped into
a coastwise steamer instead of being drowned.</p>

<p class="indent">It&#39;s all wonderful, about grandmother&#39;s being courted at a
Harvest Ball, and her grandmother running to get fire in a swing-pail,
and funny little old songs they sing. Do you know what
I feel as if I had done? I feel my roots pushing right down into
the ground, and I love the ground, and it loves my roots.</p>

<p class="indent">Also, I love you, my own Jeanie, and more so all the time as I
grow better. Some time I am going to show you all this Cape.
Well, now I must take up my cross and my scare again. I almost
forgot it when I was writing.</p>

<p class="right">Your
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When she had finished and stamped this letter,
Elizabeth took it in her hand and went slowly down
the stairs. It was nearly time for the auto-bus from
the morning train, the rumble of which could be
heard distinctly on the street beyond that on which
the old house stood. Elizabeth always waited for
this before she went to the post office. She had heard
the whistle of the train some time since.</p>

<p class="indent">Her grandmother stood at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The barge has turned in on our street, and it&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
stopping here,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess we&#39;re going to
have company. I&#39;m dretful glad Father killed
those roosters this morning. There&#39;s plenty cooked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who do you suppose it is?&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some o&#39; Father&#39;s folks. They&#39;re always turning
up when least expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth watched the high-set, curtained vehicle,
a hybrid motor truck and picnic carryall that had
been converted to its present use by the exigencies of
&quot;depot&quot; traffic. A boy in overalls had descended
from the driver&#39;s seat, and was lifting out a small
motor trunk by its handle, and a big, pig-skin suitcase.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, that&#39;s like Mother&#39;s trunk,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;and that suitcase is like her suitcase.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A tall, blonde woman in a blue tailored suit and a
blue veil jumped lightly out of the unwieldy conveyance,
her hand touching that of the boy in overalls.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I lift these here baggages into the house for
you?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, thank you. Thirty-five cents, isn&#39;t it? Oh,
don&#39;t bother to make change. That&#39;s all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the Land o&#39; Liberty!&quot; Grandmother exclaimed.
&quot;For the land sakes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it <i>is</i> Mother!&quot; cried Elizabeth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></p>

<p class="indent">Madget was sitting on the floor, and singing
to herself:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I am a little love, and I&#39;m sitting on the floor.</span>
<span class="i0">They put me here to sit and sing,</span>
<span class="i0">Eating cookies as I sing,</span>
<span class="i0">On Grandma Swiftie&#39;s lovely floor.</span>
<span class="i0">A little girl I used to be</span>
<span class="i0">Is sitting on the floor.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think you have sung almost enough,
Madget?&quot; Mrs. Swift said. &quot;What&#39;s the matter,
Elizabeth? Don&#39;t <i>you</i> think she has?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. I was just listening to the
sound of your voice, Mother. It&#39;s so good to hear it
again&mdash;saying anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; said Madget, pausing between
selections only long enough to reply literally to the
question addressed to her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;A little girl with yellow teeth</span>
<span class="i0">Was sitting on the kitchen floor.</span>
<span class="i0">She sat and sang most all day long,</span>
<span class="i0">And et some cookies all day long,</span>
<span class="i0">On Grandma Swiftie&#39;s lovely floor.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;She certainly has a keen sense of rhythm,&quot; Mrs.
Swift laughed. &quot;You&#39;ve grown up so, Elizabeth, I
hardly know my child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not really a child any longer, Mother, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you would care to walk down to
the block and get a quart of ice-cream so soon after
breakfast, would you, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Mother, I can always eat ice-cream.&quot;
Elizabeth swept the gingham frock she was making
for Madget out of her lap and rose hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve quite lost my little girl,&quot; Mrs.
Swift smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For that, Mummy, darling, I won&#39;t go. You are
just playing tricks on me, the way you always do, and
I fall right into the trap the way I always do, and
oh, it&#39;s so good to have it happening again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may go for ice-cream if you like, but a
maturer Elizabeth might prefer to wait until it was a
little nearer dinner time. When you sat down, you
were going to whip all the seams in that dress before
you moved again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want some ice-cream!&quot; wailed Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall have some bye and bye, dear. Don&#39;t
you know that nice little girls don&#39;t shriek like that?&quot;
Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me,&quot; Mrs. Swift laughed, &quot;I think I&#39;ll have
to make a kindergarten teacher out of you. You
have the professionally maternal manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;But I have grown older, Mother, and soberer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve taken hold of life better. To tell you the
truth, I was worried about you this spring, you
seemed to be getting your sense of values so wrong.
You were running around with nice, wholesome
children enough, but your ideas of life seemed to be
growing very artificial. That was one reason I sent
you down here by yourself. I was pretty sure that
you would learn some of the essential lessons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you would have been disappointed if I
hadn&#39;t, Mother. I might not have. At first I just
thought it was all horrid and&mdash;common.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth hung her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you know that nice little girls don&#39;t use
that word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn&#39;t any other that says it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is one of the words which reflect on the
user. It&#39;s one mostly used by people who have just
come to realize that there is a difference in manners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s awful to be a snob, isn&#39;t it, Mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve just discovered that I was one. Mother,
what do you suppose made me so snobbish about the
Cape when I first came down? You&#39;re not a snob,
and Father isn&#39;t, nor Jeanie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid it was the disadvantage of your bringing
up, my dear. We had some pretty hard knocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
when you were growing up. Your father&#39;s advancement
came late. We always lived nicely and had the
same standards as other people, but we had a greater
struggle to maintain them. Our lean years gave you
a little sense of inferiority, my dear, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mother, how much you know and how wise
you are! There is something I wish I could tell you
about, Mother, dear, but I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean about Buddy and Ruth Farraday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know you knew,&quot; Elizabeth gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t until the night I came away, and then
Buddy told me. It was very brave and dear of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mother, what shall we do?&quot; Elizabeth wailed.
&quot;Ruthie is going to be married next week. Maybe
before Buddy gets here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandmother told me so last night. I don&#39;t
think there is anything to do, excepting to let matters
take their course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But couldn&#39;t you go and see Ruth, and tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell her what? That my boy loves her and that
she should have loved him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she should. She almost does, I think.
She&#39;s just marrying because her dreadful
mother&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She <i>is</i> a dreadful mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So are we all sometimes, but it takes our contemporaries
to judge us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
&quot;But you are so nice, and she isn&#39;t, Mother, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth, if you are in the confidence of the
Farraday family in any way that I am not, you must
not share that confidence with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s Buddy&#39;s future we are talking about, and
if I know things that will help us to work it out, I
think I ought to be allowed to tell them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I can manage to get a perspective on
Buddy&#39;s future without gossiping about the Farradays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, why can&#39;t you go and tell Ruthie about
Buddy? Tell her he&mdash;he loves her, right out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you do that, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I was scared to; besides, it would have been
sneaky to Buddy, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But now she&#39;ll be married if somebody doesn&#39;t
do something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid there is nothing to be done but sit
still and let her <i>be</i> married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how can you, Mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know how I can, to tell the truth. That&#39;s
about the hardest thing any mother does, to sit still
and let things happen that involve her children,
but as your father says, a man&#39;s first duty is to mind
his own business, and if at first you don&#39;t succeed,
try, try again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; echoed Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you happy, Madget?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want some ice-cream and some doughnuts
and some cookies and some boiled ham, and I want
to come and sit on your lap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may have some ice-cream pretty soon and
you may come and sit on my lap now. Will that
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know who I love,&quot; Madget said, pushing aside
the folds of gingham and climbing into the coveted
place, &quot;but I won&#39;t tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want to see the beautiful present that my
mother brought me, Madget?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want a beautiful present,&quot; said Madget.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to give you a present,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;but not now, because you asked for it. It isn&#39;t nice
to ask for things. You must just wait until people
give them to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Madget said, unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the way those children are,&quot; Elizabeth
explained, seriously, &quot;Moses especially. You tell
them what isn&#39;t nice, and then they agree with you,
and there isn&#39;t any argument. It just leaves you
feeling flat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madget is only waiting seraphically for her
present to come without asking,&quot; Mrs. Swift said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See what I have!&quot; Elizabeth took a gayly-coloured
rubber cape and bathing cap to match from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
the back of the chair on which she was sitting, and
spread them out for the child&#39;s inspection. &quot;I carry
them around everywhere I go, Mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rainbows,&quot; said Madget, ecstatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all the rainbow colours,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;isn&#39;t it lovely, Mother, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so glad you like it. I had a bad time making
up my mind what to get.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These capes look so grand when you come out of
the water, and it&#39;s cold, too, running up to the bath-house.
You really need something. Look here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget had insinuated her bobbing curls into the
depths of the cap, and then, standing, was swathing
herself in the folds of the bright cape.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She looks like one of the Stewart babies. I don&#39;t
know why, but I suppose it&#39;s that dressed-up look
they have. Her hair is clean, because I washed it
myself. What are you laughing at, Mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems so extraordinary to have you in charge
of a family of children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, somebody had to take an interest in them.
It&#39;s Grandmother that takes the real care of them,
though. I only help as I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Swift smiled a smile of deep satisfaction into
her embroidery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very pleased with you, dear,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother,&quot; Elizabeth&#39;s gaze became fixed out of
the window, &quot;a boy comes to call on me sometimes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
I don&#39;t think you would disapprove, because
Grandfather invited him&mdash;but there he comes
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He looks like a nice boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is. He&#39;s quite sensible, when you get to know
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, go to the door, Elizabeth. He looks
as if he might run away if he wasn&#39;t admitted
instantly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess he has heard you&#39;re here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do?&quot; Tom Robbins said to the
widening crack that gave him his glimpse of Elizabeth,
&quot;I can&#39;t wait till you get the door open.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do?&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Captain Swift at home? I don&#39;t want to see
him, but I have to ask for him because he told me
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but my mother is,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I want to see <i>her</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here she is, then. Mother,&quot; Elizabeth led the
way into the living room, &quot;this is Mr. Robbins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad to meet Mr. Robbins. I think that his
other name is Tom, or if it isn&#39;t it ought to be, for
he&#39;s the image of the Tom Robbins I knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father remembers you,&quot; Tom cried. &quot;He used
to see you when you were first married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take some chairs,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s our joke,&quot; Tom explained, &quot;the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
time I came here Captain Swift was so full of fun,
and everything&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That, well, I got rattled,&quot; Elizabeth explained,
&quot;so I said, &#39;take some chairs,&#39; and we always say it
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taking chairs just about describes me when I
go into a place. I move around a good deal,&quot; Tom
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could have my present,&quot; Madget interrupted
from the sofa, &quot;I <i>would</i> be good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At dinner time I am going to give it to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Madget said, &quot;I&#39;ll go ask Grandma
Swift to have my dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t she cunning?&quot; Tom looked after her as
she trotted off. &quot;Oh, Elizabeth, I&#39;m going to give
Moses my old bicycle. It isn&#39;t doing any one any
good now. I&#39;m making him a rack to go in front,
that he can carry milk bottles on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandfather will give him a job carrying milk
then,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Won&#39;t that be fine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me that you children are quite
practical philanthropists. I think you are doing
wonders for the Steppes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all Elizabeth,&quot; Tom said, &quot;she&#39;s the one that
got us all thinking of it. What I came in this morning
for is this, Mrs. Swift. Our family is going to give
a big, old-fashioned clambake on the beach the first
pleasant day after Monday, and we wanted&mdash;that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
I did&mdash;we thought perhaps Peggy and Elizabeth
might like to come. It&#39;ll be great fun. Bill and I
are going to help dig the clams. Of course it&#39;s just a
family affair, and I don&#39;t know whether Father
knows you are in town, Mrs. Swift, but I am sure if
you would like to come, too, we should all be so very
glad. We thought of Elizabeth and Peggy first, you
see.&quot; Tom was very confused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you, Tom, but I shouldn&#39;t be
able to go. I am expecting my husband and my sick
son almost any day now, and my object in coming
ahead of them is to get everything in running order
for them, but I am sure Elizabeth would be delighted
to go, and I should be very glad for her to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, thank you. Mrs. Farraday said that Peggy
could come if Elizabeth could. I think it will be
pretty good sport. It will be a regular, old-fashioned
clambake, you know, with the clams banked in
bricks and sand, and all the things wrapped in seaweed
and steamed in&mdash;in their own steam. We have
one every year, and some of our family comes from a
long way to be there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it will be beautiful,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I
am so glad Mummy will let me go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I had my twenty-seven white horses,&quot;
she sighed, as she watched Tom&#39;s retreating figure.
&quot;He&#39;s nice mannered, isn&#39;t he? He always whips
off his hat at the gate, just like that. He&#39;d count for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
one red-head so nicely. I got my ninety-nine
Negroes, but the white horses are very hard to get.
I&#39;ve only got four and a half, and I&#39;m not sure it
wasn&#39;t the same white horse all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four and a half white horses?&quot; Mrs. Swift
looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A white goat. That&#39;s what I mean by half. We
saw him one way down in Chatham. I don&#39;t really
mean to count him unless we get desperate. I don&#39;t
suppose it&#39;s quite fair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have to make a good many compromises in
this day and age, but it doesn&#39;t seem to me that a
goat would make an efficient substitute for a horse.
Why stop there? Why not a pig or a bear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t really mean to count him. Peggy
and I get discouraged, and then we try to think of
encouraging things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t seen Peggy yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s coming soon, but she has to help Ruth
make that dreadful trousseau. I&#39;m going upstairs
and get Madget&#39;s doll, and then I&#39;m going to telephone
and see where she is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Solemnly seated on the floor in the guest chamber,
Elizabeth found Madget contemplating the Little
Red Riding Hood doll that Mrs. Swift had brought
for her. It stood upright on the bureau and returned
her gaze complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that my present?&quot; Madget said. &quot;I want it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have come upstairs without being
sent, Madget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was sent. You sent me for a thimble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that was yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here it is,&quot; Madget said, producing it with a
wide smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s your present,&quot; Elizabeth said in
despair. &quot;Take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madget took it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My baby dolly!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">As Elizabeth started downstairs again, she heard
Peggy&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t need to telephone,&quot; Peggy cried, from
the sitting room, &quot;I came and I brought the bride
along with me, what there is left of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know it was going to be quite so much
trouble to be married,&quot; Ruth Farraday was saying,
&quot;perhaps if I had, I wouldn&#39;t have attempted it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this is the last marriage I can ever have in
my family,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;unless I ever take the fatal
step myself, which I won&#39;t. You&#39;re just the same,
aren&#39;t you, Elizabeth? You can only have one outside
of your own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think Buddy will ever marry,&quot; Elizabeth
said, looking at Ruth Farraday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son is coming to-morrow or the next day,&quot;
Mrs. Swift said, hastily, &quot;we hope that Cape Cod is
really going to make him well again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
&quot;He&#39;ll be here in time for the wedding,&quot; Peggy
said, &quot;if he is invited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were planning to have only the family,&quot;
Ruth said, &quot;but not having two sisters to add the
proper touch of picturesqueness, I asked Elizabeth to
stand with Peggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She never opened her mouth,&quot; said the incorrigible
Peggy, indicating herself, &quot;excepting to put her
foot into it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, Peggy,&quot; said Ruth, whitening a little,
&quot;Mrs. Swift understands. Peggy regards this wedding
as a sort of cross between a picnic and a visit to
the dentist&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly do,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;only you don&#39;t
have to have so many clothes on those occasions. I
don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t just be married in what
you&#39;ve got. Well, anyway, that clambake is going
to be a ray of light through the gloom. That&#39;s
something we can enjoy without any mixture of our
emotions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall have to come some day without Peggy,&quot;
Ruth said, rising, &quot;this time we were just going by to
the post office and she dragged me in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She gets a letter every mail,&quot; Peggy explained,
&quot;and sometimes two a mail. If you think I&#39;ve
said awful things, Mrs. Swift, I&#39;m sorry, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I assure you they are nothing to the things she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
could say,&quot; Ruth laughed. &quot;I&#39;m glad she has
Elizabeth&#39;s restraining influence. I suppose the
two are so different that that&#39;s the reason they get on
so well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth&#39;s a perfect lady,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Swift stood at the window and watched the
two girls go down the path, Ruth&#39;s pink linen and
close-fitting white sweater outlining her extreme
slenderness and her little feet set with a delicate deliberation
as she moved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She <i>is</i> an apple-blossom girl,&quot; she said, thoughtfully,
&quot;poor Buddy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,&quot; Elizabeth wailed,
flinging her arms around her, &quot;isn&#39;t it perfectly
terrible? I am so glad you are here. I don&#39;t
believe I could have borne it another minute without
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now, I guess you&#39;re satisfied,&quot; Grandfather
said, coming in on this tableau. &quot;I guess you&#39;ve got
about all you need to make you happy, ain&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth threw a forlorn glance at her mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I need other things to make me happy,&quot; she said,
&quot;but I&#39;m perfectly satisfied with this darling person,
all the same.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Is Scared</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Baby.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Daddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth and her father were the first
ones down to breakfast on the morning after his
arrival with Buddy&mdash;the first of the visiting family,
at least. Grandfather had been outside and at
work since dawn, and Grandmother and Judidy had
been in the kitchen almost as long, employed in
magnificent preparations for feasting the returned
sons of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is all this radiance for this morning,
Elizabeth? Me or Buddy or the new roadster?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>and</i> Buddy <i>and</i> the new roadster, Father,
darling. The roadster was the completest surprise,
but I am more intimately fond of you and Buddy.
I just can&#39;t believe you are here. I gave myself a
good hard pinch every time I woke up in the night,
to try to make myself believe it. The last time, I
got up and sneaked to your door and listened to
hear if you were breathing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, was I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
&quot;You were doing more than that, Daddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you sleep when they turned you out of
your room for John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll show you bye and bye, Daddy. I&#39;ve got a
room of my own, and all I had to do was to put a
tiny, weeny little bed in it. I thought that was
going to crowd it dreadfully. Instead, it is very
becoming to it. Faith, Hope, and Charity guard my
slumbers, only I couldn&#39;t slumber, I was so excited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Faith, Hope, and Charity?&quot; her father looked
inquiring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are my guardian angels, borrowed from
Aunt Helen by permission of Grandmother. Would
you like to go out and see the pigs, Daddy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d like to but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve time before
breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, their names are Faith, Hope, and Charity,
also&mdash;this new litter, I mean. Grandfather let me
name them. They are excruciatingly cunning,
Daddy. Faith and Hope keep themselves a little
messily, but Charity is as clean as a kitten. She
knows her name, too, and comes when you call her by
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, him or her. All their names are nice and
non-committal. They can be boys or girls, whichever
they like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
&quot;I should think they were committed to a great
deal, in either event.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, children,&quot; Grandmother appeared behind
a platter heaped high with crisp, hot doughnuts,
&quot;have you got a good appetite for your breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems so funny to think of your being Grandmas
child,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s hard to believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather, who had followed on his wife&#39;s heels,
took his place at the head of the table, and shook out
his napkin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve heard tell of a feller that went driving down
Chatham way one day,&quot; he said, &quot;and he come to an
old house in the woods, and there he found a little
old man sitting on the doorstep that was so old and
palsied and shaky, he could hardly make out to
speak at all. Well, this feller he wanted to find out
how the old man happened to be left alone at his
great age, with no care nor companionship nor
nothing, so he asked him; he says &#39;Do you live all
alone here?&#39; he says. The little old man he was
so deaf he couldn&#39;t hardly hear nothing, but this
feller he asked him again, and he put his hand up to
his ears and just made out to catch the question.
&#39;No,&#39; he says in his high-pitched, quavering voice,
&#39;No, I don&#39;t live here all alone, I live here with my
father.&#39;&mdash;&#39;Your father?&#39; this feller says, all taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
aback, &#39;Your father? Have you got a father?
Where is he?&#39; The little old man he hardly made out
to get this question at all, but after a long time,
when it had been repeated to him over and over
again, he managed to understand it. &#39;Where&#39;s
Father?&#39; he says. &#39;You ask me where my father is?
Well, where should he be, &#39;cepting upstairs, putting
Grandfather to bed.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Swift laughed immoderately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose it does look a little like that to Elizabeth,&quot;
he said. &quot;She&#39;s used to thinking of me as
being about as old as that kind of relative gets to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandfather&#39;s whole life is spent in teasing me,&quot;
Elizabeth said, &quot;it&#39;s bread and butter and pie and
cake to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, Father, where is your pie this
morning? I didn&#39;t know that you ever started the
day without it, but I don&#39;t see it on the table.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, I am going to tell something on Father,&quot;
Grandmother said, slyly. &quot;He ain&#39;t had a piece o&#39;
pie for his breakfast since Elizabeth come, and he
wouldn&#39;t let me put none on the table, either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was afraid she&#39;d get to making it the way she
makes cake, and I&#39;d have to eat it whether or no.&quot;
Grandfather mopped his brow with a great show of
vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It warn&#39;t that,&quot; Grandmother smiled. &quot;He was
just sprucing up for his city granddaughter a little.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
He went down street and got two new neckties and a
white cotton vest before she&#39;d been here a week. He
had to kind of jerk Elizabeth down a peg and jerk
himself up several to meet her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Granddaddy <i>Swift</i>,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;have
you been going without your breakfast pie on my
account?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who said breakfast pie?&quot; a gaunt figure in
khaki appeared in the doorway, and Elizabeth,
with one admonishing finger still uplifted, turned
from her grandfather and with one leap hurled
herself upon it. &quot;I&#39;m going to get out of these clothes
to-morrow,&quot; Buddy continued, calmly, holding his
sister off with one hand, &quot;but I have forgotten how
to get into regular trousers before breakfast. Emerson,
the well-known sage of Concord, used to eat pie
for his breakfast&mdash;pumpkin pie, and it goes very well
with coffee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandfather won&#39;t let me have so much as a
snitch of coffee,&quot; Elizabeth pouted, still clinging to
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not even a demi-tassy,&quot; Grandfather put in, slyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a good thing, too,&quot; Buddy said. &quot;Granddad,
your ideas of bringing up Elizabeth are a good
deal like my own&mdash;a firm, strong hand applied wherever
necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And last but not least&mdash;Mother,&quot; said Elizabeth,
pausing in the midst of a grimace at her brother. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
never knew you to be the last one at the breakfast
table in my life before, Mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Mrs. Swift said, as she took her place
between her children, &quot;and oh, John and I have our
napkin rings! I was going to bear it with resignation
if we didn&#39;t, but I am so glad to see them again.
We had them on our honeymoon, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth had one for a while, but she didn&#39;t
seem to admire it, not what you might call beyond
reason,&quot; Grandfather said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;the instances keep
piling up of the way he has seen right through me
from the first minute of my coming, but now I&#39;m
beginning to see through him,&quot; she added, triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When anybody makes up their mind they are
beginning to see through Father, there is generally
breakers ahead for them,&quot; Grandmother said,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s from Father that I get whatever business
acumen I have,&quot; John Swift said; &quot;let the other
fellow think he is getting away with everything, and
then when he has given himself entirely away, never
let up on him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s my principle,&quot; Grandfather said,
complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going into Father&#39;s office, did you know it?&quot;
Buddy said. &quot;Until day before yesterday I might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
just as well have thought of getting a job with J. P.
Morgan, and then suddenly this opening came, and
my old boss recommended me for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We lost a good man suddenly,&quot; John Swift explained,
&quot;and yesterday morning old Howard came
in to me and asked me what I knew of a youngster
named John Smith that used to be with the Urner
Company. I was pretty sure he had got the name
wrong, so I told him I&#39;d call up the Urner office and
find out if he was the one I thought he was. In the
afternoon, just before I left, Howard asked me if I
found out anything about the boy, and if I knew anything
to his advantage or disadvantage. &#39;I do,&#39; I
said, &#39;both. He&#39;s my son.&#39; &#39;We&#39;ll take him in,&#39;
Howard said, &#39;I guess you know how to handle him
by this time.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see,&quot; Buddy explained, &quot;I began to get busy
on the hospital wire just as soon as I realized I was
cured, and my old boss is a white man, if ever there
was one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not going to Russia just at present?&quot; his father
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not going to Russia,&quot; Buddy said, steadily.</p>

<p class="indent">After breakfast Elizabeth had her first minute
alone with her brother. They were in the living room,
in Grandmother&#39;s and Grandfather&#39;s chairs respectively,
with the big fern branching between them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Sister?&quot; Buddy said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&quot;Well, Buddy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you know about Ruth, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About Ruth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Sister, darling, you heard me the first time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean how&mdash;how is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean, tell me everything you know that you
haven&#39;t told me before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven&#39;t you talked with Mother about her since
you came?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hasn&#39;t she told you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I&#39;ve got to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You certainly have&mdash;and quick,&quot; said Buddy.
&quot;What is it? Fire away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruth&mdash;Ruth is going to&mdash;to get married next
week&mdash;Thursday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; Buddy&#39;s jaw shut on the monosyllable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was hurried up all of a sudden. I saw her
and talked with her on the beach once, and she said
to tell you that your telegram was a day too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Buddy, briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She sent her love, and said you were a day too
late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll see about that. Is this Chambers fellow
around?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he is in Boston, but he comes down to see
her all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
&quot;We&#39;ll see about that, too. What&#39;s her telephone
number?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thirty-two, ring eleven. You have to ring in,
you know&mdash;that handle on the box, and ask Central.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; said Buddy, &quot;telephone is nice
and convenient, isn&#39;t it? Anybody on the farm can
hear from this location,&quot; he picked up the instrument
from the desk in the corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I go?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to speak to Miss Ruth Farraday&mdash;Mr.
Swift.&quot; He put his hand over the mouthpiece, the
fingers trembled slightly, but his voice was cool, &quot;I
guess that was your friend Peggy. Sounded like a
flapper&#39;s voice. She&#39;s gone to call her. Oh, hello,
Ruth,&quot; he said into the instrument, &quot;this is John.
Yes, I managed to squirm out. Fine, thank you.
A little under weight, that&#39;s all. I want to see you.
Now, this morning, may I come over there? I
wouldn&#39;t take up much time. Yes it <i>is</i> important.
Oh, all right, that will be better yet. I am perfectly
able to make it, but I&#39;d rather have you here if you&#39;ll
come. All right. In about half an hour. All right.
Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s coming here,&quot; he explained to Elizabeth,
&quot;she was starting out to do some errands. She
didn&#39;t want me there, at any rate. Perhaps Chambers
is expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
&quot;The walls of that house are as thin as paper,&quot;
Elizabeth said, &quot;and I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t have to go
there. Her mother might be around.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s awfully decent of her to come here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She <i>is</i> awfully decent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s scared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who wouldn&#39;t be?&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;My gracious!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I ought to try to get into some kind of
decent clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;stay in those.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I&#39;ve been mustered out. I ought to be in
&#39;cits&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;d like you better in those,&quot; Elizabeth said,
positively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know how I know, but I know,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;I&#39;m a girl, and I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you are,&quot; Buddy said. &quot;I never thought
of it before, but you&#39;re a girl and you&#39;ve got a line
on girls. Do I look pretty punk to you? Cadaverous
and all that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the handsomest thing,&quot; Elizabeth cried,
&quot;that I ever saw, Buddy. You used to be good looking,
but now you&#39;ve got a kind of&mdash;look&mdash;a soulful
look&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;ll do. I was only interested in my physical
aspect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
&quot;Well, that&#39;s perfect,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is my face clean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see. Yes, it is, perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I won&#39;t go upstairs at all. You just sit
around and help me kill time till she comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Buddy, can I kiss you just once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot,&quot; said Buddy. &quot;I&#39;ve changed a
good deal in a great many ways, but I haven&#39;t got
to the point where I like to be kissed after breakfast
yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You used to write pretty affectionately from those
old trenches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was an ocean between us then, and it was
perfectly safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think men are the funniest things,&quot; Elizabeth
said. &quot;It isn&#39;t that they don&#39;t want to be
loved&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it isn&#39;t,&quot; said Buddy. &quot;So tell Mother to
keep the coast clear, will you, and then come back.
No, don&#39;t come back. I&#39;ll watch for Ruth and let
her in. No, you watch for Ruth and let her in. You
bring her in here, and then get out unless I tell you to
stick around. See?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t tell me that before her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can tell anybody anything before her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;but&mdash;but I&#39;m scared,
Buddy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you go to the deuce,&quot; her brother said, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
only then did Elizabeth realize the strain under which
he was labouring.</p>

<p class="indent">It was with a face nearly as white as Buddy&#39;s own
that she opened the door to Ruth a few minutes
later.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy&#39;s in there,&quot; she said, weakly, to Ruth&#39;s
inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come and show me,&quot; Ruth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right this way,&quot; Elizabeth said, superfluously.
&quot;Buddy, here&#39;s Ruth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Buddy, unfolding his long legs
from the rocking chair, and advancing so slowly that
Elizabeth knew he was trembling with weakness,
&quot;you may go now, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please,&quot; said Ruth Farraday in her low voice,
&quot;let her stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Buddy, &quot;you may stay, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather go,&quot; said Elizabeth, miserably. But
neither of the two paid any more attention to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth put out her hand, and then when Buddy
would have taken it, withdrew it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to be married,&quot; she said, &quot;next week.
Did Elizabeth tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Buddy. &quot;It&#39;s me you should be
marrying. You know that, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Ruth Farraday. &quot;Yes, I do know it,
I think. But it&#39;s too late now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s not too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t seem to understand that I am going to
be married&mdash;married next week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard you the first time,&quot; said Buddy, grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are my girl,&quot; said Buddy, &quot;and you know
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing I do,&quot; said Ruth Farraday, &quot;what
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then this marriage is a lie. It can&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has&mdash;happened, as far as I am concerned. I
have given my word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruth, you can&#39;t mean that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means a lifetime of misery for three people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s all done, now. That&#39;s all there is to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean, you haven&#39;t the courage to break
away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean more than that. This has happened,
that&#39;s all, I&#39;ve given my word. I&#39;ve let things get
where they are. If you wanted to marry me, you
should have told me when I was free. I waited for
you, for just a word or a line from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was sick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t waiting for you to get well, and write
me you were well. I wanted to know that you
thought of me when you were sick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Ruth, I didn&#39;t think of anything else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
&quot;I waited as long as I could, that was all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ruth&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Buddy said, &quot;Ruth&mdash;&mdash;&quot; He took a
long step toward her, &quot;Get out of this room, Elizabeth,&quot;
he said, steadily, &quot;you are willing for her to go,
dear, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he said, as Ruth put out a restraining
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Oh, I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d better go,&quot; said Elizabeth, and Buddy nodded
to her as she slipped out. Before the door had
closed on her, he had walked across the floor and
taken Ruth Farraday in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly half an hour later that Elizabeth,
watching from the room above, saw Buddy walk with
Ruth to the gate, open it for her, and stand with his
head bared as she walked down the street. She ran
down the stairs breathlessly to meet him as he came
in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it all right?&quot; she asked. &quot;Oh, Buddy, is it all
right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all right, little sister,&quot; Buddy said, &quot;it&#39;s all
right anyway, the way she wants it. She won&#39;t
break it off. She thinks it wouldn&#39;t be honourable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she must break it off, Buddy. It&#39;ll kill you
if she doesn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it won&#39;t. She must do what she wants to
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she doesn&#39;t know what she wants,&quot; Elizabeth
cried.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
&quot;She knows what&#39;s right for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe she does at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do know this,&quot; Elizabeth cried, &quot;you can&#39;t
stand it, Buddy, it will kill you. It will kill you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, then,&quot; said Buddy, &quot;let it. But I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s going to. She wouldn&#39;t want it to, you
see.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Shakes Hands</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; Peggy said, surveying the picnic
tables set up in the pine grove beyond
their customary bathing beach, &quot;this is
certainly some party. I never saw so many pumpkin
pies in conclave assembled in all my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pumpkin pies are just the background,&quot; Elizabeth
said, &quot;all these regular New England dishes
don&#39;t count; they always have them. Brown bread
and biscuits and cake and watermelon. They always
have them. The stuff they are baking is the real
party.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This being your first clambake, you are just
repeating what you&#39;ve been told. I know. It was
nice of the boys to send for us, so we could be sure
and be here early, but where are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Something-or-other Robbins, that tall
woman with the earrings, told me the boys had been
sent to Harwich for some more provisions, but they
will be back right away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather a good-looking crowd of people, aren&#39;t
they? And what a lot of work they&#39;ve done. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
tables were put up last night, and every family contributed
some of this milder grub&mdash;I mean these
foods on the tables, if I must be polite. The men
dug the clams and furnished all the other things. I
asked Tom how they managed. Look, there are
Mabel and Madget down on the beach, right in the
heart of the bake. I&#39;ll bet Tom told them they
could hang around.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know what, Peggy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What particular what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mabel is my last red-head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she&#39;s my next to the last, come to think of
it. It was lucky we went to the cattle show, and got
all those white horses at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to shake hands with anybody to-day.
It&#39;s hard to remember, though. Just now I
shook hands with Tom&#39;s father and his uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Those old men don&#39;t count, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure? Tom&#39;s uncle is quite a young
widower, Mother says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to worry, because you didn&#39;t
have Mabel when you shook hands. Now is the
time to look out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are safe until you see another red-head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s go down on the beach and see what the
mound builders have accomplished,&quot; Peggy said,
&quot;that large woman in the yellow skirt is going to
come over here and entertain us if we don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
&quot;I think we will go down on the beach,&quot; Elizabeth
said to the large woman, as they turned to walk
in her direction, &quot;of course we would like to help if
we could, but Mrs. Robbins said there wasn&#39;t anything
left to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have everything done, I think,&quot; said the
woman, whose name they did not know. &quot;The
boys are going to bring back some vines to trail over
the table, and some paper napkins to twist up in the
glasses. We do everything the same way every
year, to keep up the tradition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it&#39;s awfully nice,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;and we
appreciate being included.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We always have a table of young people. The
boys are always privileged to invite their&mdash;friends.
Dear me, I must count noses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There she bustles off, counting noses,&quot; Peggy
said. &quot;I don&#39;t like her so much, but I guess she&#39;s
a good-hearted one. Now&#39;s our chance to break
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They scrambled down the steep embankment to
the beach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the only time I ever didn&#39;t slide down,
sitting,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;I don&#39;t believe in being
civilized unless you have to. I only ate a cross-section
of burnt toast this morning, and drank some
feeble cocoa. I&#39;ll be too hungry to eat pretty soon.
We now approach the most celebrated of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
relics of the mound builders, a perfectly intact mound
about six feet long and broad in proportion. This
mound is a perfect specimen of the mound builders
art. It is made of bricks and sand. A huge fire
was first built on the base of this erection, in the ashes
of which are baking, at the present moment, luscious
ears of corn dressed in their original wrappers, huge
sweet, or garden potatoes, clams by the galore, as our
cook says, and, I strongly suspect, lobsters and bluefish,
to complete the assortment. Dost like the
picture, Love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s all that seaweed sticking out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The things are steamed in seaweed, darling.
That&#39;s what gives them their galumptious flavour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mabel and Madget drew near as they saw their
friends approaching.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it a grave?&quot; Madget asked in an awed whisper,
as she indicated the erection respectfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a giant&#39;s grave,&quot; Peggy said. &quot;Fee, foo, fi, fum.
Can&#39;t you smell the blood of an English giant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I can&#39;t,&quot; said Mabel, &quot;them&#39;s just clams, and
we&#39;m going to have some. Moses has gone to ride
with Tom and he told me to stay here and watch, to
see if the clams didn&#39;t burn. They ain&#39;t burnt yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&#39;s your mother?&quot; Elizabeth asked, hastily,
as she saw the rising laughter in Peggy&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s better, and she&#39;s got a purple velvet dress,&quot;
Mabel said, &quot;she got breakfast to-day, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
&quot;What did she get for breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fried fish and potatoes, and elderberry wine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall choke,&quot; Peggy cried, &quot;anything anybody
says to-day strikes me so funny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can laugh at me,&quot; Mabel said, unexpectedly,
&quot;I don&#39;t care. I ain&#39;t funny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy sank on the sand and gave way to merriment.
Mabel regarded her kindly, and Elizabeth
took advantage of the occasion to tie four shoe-strings
in double bows, and comb two curly heads
with the side comb of which she relieved the helpless
Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This week has been such an awful strain,&quot; Peggy
said, wiping her eyes, &quot;that whenever I get a reaction,
I&#39;m off. Oh, there come the boys, now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Awfully sorry,&quot; Tom said, hurrying down the
beach. He gave a hand to Peggy, which she shook
heartily, and then extended it to Elizabeth, who was
a little farther away.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth gave a little shriek, and put her own
hands behind her back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a kind of a sore finger,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll remember and not scrunch it,&quot; Tom said,
&quot;if I get the chance, that is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s going to be sore all the week, isn&#39;t it, Elizabeth?&quot;
asked the irrepressible Peggy. &quot;I&#39;m all right,
because I&#39;m&mdash;oh!&mdash;oh!&quot; she shrieked, glancing at
Tom&#39;s blazing hair.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
&quot;What&#39;s all this mystery?&quot; Bill said, joining the
group.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy is just slightly indisposed, as usual,&quot; Tom
said. &quot;She has one of her light attacks of mental
derangement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m a psycho&mdash;psycho&mdash;whatever&mdash;it&mdash;is case,&quot;
Peggy said. &quot;I&#39;ll be all right when I have had most
of what&#39;s under there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a giant&#39;s grave full of clams and oysters and
ice-cream and potato salud and pumpkin pie,&quot;
Madget elucidated in a sing-song voice, &quot;and I am
going to have some of all of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t leave much room for the giant, does it,
Madget?&quot; Tom said, &quot;but you are right about
having some of all of it. We have a nice New York
guy coming pretty soon. I asked him specially for
you, Elizabeth. I know you have a warm spot in
your heart for anybody that lives around Grant&#39;s
Tomb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he your cousin?&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he&#39;s just a fellow I see around the town sometimes.
We hit it off pretty well, and he doesn&#39;t
know many people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stoddard, Robert Stoddard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where does he live?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;New York City, New York State, Manhattan
Island.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
&quot;I mean, what part of New York?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know that. New York&#39;s all New
York to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to live in New York next year,&quot; Elizabeth
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you always had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, we lived in New Jersey, but now we&#39;re going
to take an apartment in town. It&#39;s just been decided,
and I am so excited about it, I can hardly breathe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about school?&quot; Peggy asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to study with Jean this winter. She
has always had private teachers, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be fine for you,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;but
don&#39;t let&#39;s think about next winter. When do we
eat, Bill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In about half an hour, or less.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on up to the grove,&quot; Tom said. &quot;I told
Bob I&#39;d meet him by the road and kind of work him
in among the crowd. We sure have a raft of relations
when they are all got together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we bring Madget and Mabel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure. Moses is up there now, right in the heart
of the picnic. He was trying to catch watermelon
juice between the cracks of the table, where they
were cutting it, the last I saw of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want some watermelon,&quot; said Madget, leading
the procession.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see what I did?&quot; Peggy whispered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
Elizabeth as they followed the others. &quot;I shook
hands with Tom. I never thought. I just did,
that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you didn&#39;t have your last red-head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He made the last red-head, don&#39;t you see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never thought of that. Do you think he counts
that way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whether he does or not. I don&#39;t
want to count him, but I want to play fair. Only
I shouldn&#39;t think, as a general proposition, that shaking
hands with your last red-head mattered one way
or the other. I didn&#39;t even consciously remember
that he was my last red-head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the one. If you
had really counted him first as a red-head and then
shaken hands with him, you&#39;d have to call him the
first boy you shook hands with, but he really isn&#39;t, as
it stands. Now that you&#39;ve counted him, if you
shook hands with him again, why&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you bet I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll put my hands behind
me the way you did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought just in time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom dropped behind his friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bill wants you to walk with him,&quot; he said to
Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure I do, but Tom said it first,&quot; Bill grinned,
&quot;he wants to walk with you, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll beat you climbing up the bank,&quot; Peggy cried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
making for the sheer wall of soil and roots ahead of
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t beat me,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;I&#39;ll go
round by the road, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some people have a great amount of superfluous
energy,&quot; Tom said, &quot;Bill and Peggy are
pretty well matched for that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy is only a tomboy at times,&quot; Elizabeth said,
&quot;she really has quite an old mind, when you get to
know her as well as I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather get to know you as well as she
does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she sees me every day, almost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish it hadn&#39;t been almost halfway through
the summer before you and I met. I&#39;ve got to go
home Monday,&quot; Tom said, mournfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know that. I thought you were going
to stay through September, like the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s all decided for Monday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s too bad. It will break up our summer
crowd, sort of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that all you care?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose I ought to be thankful for small
favours. I haven&#39;t hardly seen you, except around
at your grandfather&#39;s, and with Peggy and everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we&#39;ve had a good time,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
Tom kicked out at a giant horseshoe that obstructed
his path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darn the good time,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Elizabeth, hastily, &quot;we&#39;d better catch
up with the children. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;ll
be into.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Tom muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t that your friend waiting up there by the
path?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tom,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;don&#39;t be cross. I
haven&#39;t done anything, have I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, and you won&#39;t do anything. That&#39;s the
trouble. Even say a kind word. Come ahead, I
suppose I&#39;ve got to collect that guy and drag him
round among the animals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That isn&#39;t a very nice way to speak of your
relations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elizabeth, there&#39;s Bill and Peggy talking to
Bob&mdash;he&#39;ll keep a minute. Aren&#39;t you sorry that
I&#39;m going away Monday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How sorry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite a lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you write?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Mother&#39;ll let me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she usually let you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she never has.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;You told me yourself that Peggy wrote to a boy.
Bill&#39;s going to get her to write to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said I would if my mother will let me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The question is&mdash;will she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she does, I will. Aren&#39;t you satisfied?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you are just saying that to please me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you want to be pleased?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you want me to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you say it if you did?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do I know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Girls are the hardest things to get anything out
of&mdash;Elizabeth&quot;&mdash;little beads of dampness stood out
on Tom&#39;s forehead&mdash;&quot;Elizabeth, will you, I mean,
do you, I mean, would you care&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurry up there,&quot; Peggy called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody&#39;s supposed to take their places,&quot; Bill
cried, &quot;come ahead, you two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They want us,&quot; Elizabeth said, relieved that the
tte--tte was over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re all introduced,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;but Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Swift, I want you to meet my friend Mr.
Stoddard,&quot; Tom said, doing the honours.</p>

<p class="indent">The tall boy standing between Peggy and Bill
put out his hand, and Elizabeth slipped hers into it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Stoddard,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
The warning cry from Peggy came too late.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you&#39;ve done it!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has she done?&quot; the tall boy asked. His
eyes were brown and amused, and he had to look
down several inches even to reach the level of the
lanky Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, really. She had a&mdash;sore finger, and
I was afraid&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve heard about that sore finger before,&quot; Bill
said, &quot;there&#39;s some kind of a mystery about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re just full of the dickens to-day,&quot; Peggy
explained, hastily, &quot;this sparkly air has gone to my
head&mdash;our heads, I guess. Elizabeth always behaves
better than I do, but she&#39;s as far gone as she
ever is to-day. We&#39;ve just been giggling at nothing
all the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you can call Mabel and Madget nothing,&quot;
Elizabeth supplemented.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s go eat, let&#39;s go eat, let&#39;s go eat,&quot; Bill chanted.
&quot;I am so starved, I am weak. Tom and I didn&#39;t
eat any breakfast this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that&#39;s what&#39;s the matter with him,&quot;
Elizabeth smiled at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Tom said in an undertone. &quot;I&#39;ll
come out of it&mdash;for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was me that you went into it for,&quot; Elizabeth
whispered, saucily.</p>

<p class="indent">The Steppe children in a comparatively decorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
row were much more nearly a social success than on
their first public appearance. They ate steadily
and conscientiously, and their table manners compared
not unfavourably with those of the other children
of the party. Most of these ate with their
parents. Two boys of thirteen, twins, and two girls
a little younger than Peggy and Elizabeth were at
the low table, at the end of the two long rows
of family tables that Tom had designed for his
guests.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bet you I can eat more clams than you can,&quot;
Bill challenged Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you can,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;my idea is to go
easy on the clams, eat two sweet potatoes, one
lobster, a soupon of bluefish, all the corn I can hold,
because that&#39;s the best of all, with that grand, sea-weedy
taste it&#39;s got, and this lovely, gooey, trickly
butter. Then I shall really fill up on cake and pie.
I&#39;m not going to eat any bread, because that takes
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going to eat watermelon?&quot; Bill asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to take one of those boatshaped pieces
and get in,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The beauty of this party,&quot; Bob Stoddard said,
&quot;is that you can treat everything like that. You
can snuggle right down into all the edibles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m snuggling into my clams,&quot; Elizabeth said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
&quot;Isn&#39;t it funny that the clams you get in New York
are so distinct from these clams? They are just like
different animals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They <i>are</i> different animals,&quot; Bob said. &quot;You
like New York, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, here&#39;s to it, then,&quot; he lifted his clam shell
gayly, and Elizabeth gravely lifted one of her own.
They drained the liquor ceremoniously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope I shall see you in the winter,&quot; Bob Stoddard
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll see me,&quot; Tom interposed quickly, &quot;I&#39;m
coming on to visit you in my Christmas vacation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said that last year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this year I&#39;m coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m in a comatose condition,&quot; Peggy complained
at dusk, as they lingered under their favourite tree to
talk over the events of the day. &quot;I hope nobody will
ever mention any kind or variety of food to me
again. If Tom hadn&#39;t brought all that candy, I
should feel better, and I think those ice-cream cones
we had on the way were nasty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They tasted nice and cooling at the time,&quot;
Elizabeth said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want another one right
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And your family are all in the house there, eating,&quot;
Peggy said. &quot;Can&#39;t you hear the merry clatter
of their knives and forks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it, Peggy. Do you realize what
happened to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shook hands with that boy, you mean. I
tried to warn you, but it was all over before I could
even cough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it, and I had been fortifying myself all
summer long against doing anything like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you won&#39;t have to remain in suspense like
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe it&#39;s Tom for you, after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I know it isn&#39;t. That&#39;s a nice boy, though.
It would be funny if you really did grow up and
marry him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather marry somebody that I knew a little
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you do marry him, you will know him
better, that&#39;s one comfort. How&#39;s your brother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s pretty good. He&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;Oh, he&#39;s the best
we could hope for him to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s awfully handsome. Do you know what&#39;s
happened over at my house? My sister is getting
ready to marry a man she isn&#39;t even on speaking
terms with. They had some kind of a ruction last
night about the war or something. He drove down,
meaning to stay two or three days, and they had this
row, and he just turned around and went back.
Meantime, we merrily make trousseau and wedding
chest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
&quot;I wish that he&#39;d never come,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but he will. He&#39;ll be back to-morrow morning,
with the bells on, and the flags flying, and a
footman on the step of his car to show how classy
he is. Just you wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Elizabeth, with a glance toward
the open window of the dining room where her
brother was sitting, &quot;oh, dear, Peggy!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Ruth</span></p>

<p class="indent">The small reception room in the Farraday
cottage had been converted into a temporary
sewing room, and here Elizabeth and Peggy
were sewing on their own blue dimity frocks, fitted to
them by the Boston seamstress, who had been
working in the house, and finished except for the
hemstitching to be done on sleeves and collar.
Peggy sewed neatly but erratically, exploding into
violent protestations when her thread knotted or her
scissors fell. Elizabeth found the steady rhythm of
hemming rather soothing to her, especially to-day,
when her heart was so heavy for her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Piggy&#39;s&mdash;I mean, Mr. Chambers&#39; parents have
sent the flat silver,&quot; Peggy announced, &quot;and to my
taste it&#39;s very hideous. It&#39;s the kind with a beading all
around it. If you are going to have elaborate silver,
why&mdash;have it. Have Cupids and little birds building
nests, but if you are going to have it simple, why, then
it&#39;s a crime, I think, to have a <i>little</i> trimming on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got very good natural taste, Peggy&mdash;my
mother says so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
&quot;I know it. So&#39;s Ruth. I bet she hates this.
Just think, Elizabeth, if you marry a man it&#39;s not
only for keeps, but it&#39;s for every day, all the time,
whether he likes the things you loathe or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you shaken hands with anybody yet,
Peggy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I haven&#39;t. Have you seen your future
husband again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I passed him on the street yesterday. I like a
boy that really takes his hat off, instead of fumbling
at it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tom certainly takes his hat off&mdash;like a streak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too much like a streak. Besides, he always wears
a cap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like caps,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t. I like hats. Bob Stoddard had a hat
even at the picnic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Elizabeth,&quot; Peggy said, seriously,
&quot;I hope you really won&#39;t get interested in that
Stoddard boy. It would be kind of uncanny, and I
should feel too awfully responsible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got you into this counting business. I don&#39;t
really think there is anything in it, but if there was, I
should feel guilty all the rest of my life. I don&#39;t
want to have your marital unhappiness to consider,
the way I expect to consider Ruth&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Chambers came back, didn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&quot;I told you he would. They are on the porch
now, having a pow-wow. Mother was so rejoiced
over the prodigal&#39;s return that it was pitiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy, don&#39;t you wish that Ruth had just happened
to fancy my Buddy, and to have married him
instead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness, yes. Anybody. That doesn&#39;t sound
very flattering. You know I would have adored it,
but that&#39;s too great a piece of luck even to contemplate.
I&#39;d rather she&#39;d marry&mdash;Bill Dean than
Piggy Chambers.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I do not like you, Doctor Fell (Chambers)</span>
<span class="i0">The reason why I cannot tell,</span>
<span class="i0">But this alone I know full well,</span>
<span class="i0">I do not like you, Doctor Fell (Chambers).&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be nice to have lots of money,&quot; Elizabeth
said, &quot;and to have chauffeurs, and butlers, and
tall, elegant footmen in green livery, and estates and
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, it would, if you didn&#39;t have to take any
incumbrances with them. If you had to be handcuffed
to a fat man, in addition, that would be
something else again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life is very bewildering. Don&#39;t you think so,
Peggy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t bewilder me. It disgusts me sometimes.
All these mixups could be avoided, if people
only wouldn&#39;t be short-sighted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
&quot;Some trouble seems to come from other sources.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but most all the things that people suffer
from could be avoided if they weren&#39;t so silly. I
notice that all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, so do I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hark,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;they&#39;re at it again. If they
row like that before they are married, what will
happen to them in their honeymoon stages?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s going,&quot; Elizabeth said; &quot;she&#39;s letting him
out of the front door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good riddance to perfectly good rubbish,&quot; said
Peggy, &quot;till dinner time.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; Ruth&#39;s clear voice rose, distinctly, &quot;no, no.
I mean what I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I mean what I say. I&#39;ll see you at dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I like!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At seven then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door closed after him, and Ruth, looking
wearier and paler than Elizabeth had ever seen her,
opened the door that led from the reception room
to the hallway, and came in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take some seats,&quot; said Peggy, hospitably.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth sank into a big wicker armchair without
speaking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lovely weather we&#39;re having for this time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
year,&quot; Peggy continued, conversationally. &quot;Ruth,
dear, I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad of that,&quot; Ruth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I!&quot; said Elizabeth, timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad of that, too,&quot; said Ruth Farraday, with
her charming, wistful smile. &quot;Well, children, you
don&#39;t need to go on with those dresses. You won&#39;t
have occasion to wear them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve just told Mr. Chambers that I won&#39;t marry
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does he know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, not exactly, Peggy&mdash;that&#39;s his trouble&mdash;but
he will know it. I&#39;m&mdash;I&#39;m through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Peggy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do, and that&#39;s the principal thing,&quot; Ruth said.
&quot;I never realized how he felt about certain things
before. I hadn&#39;t given much thought to his attitude
about the war and all that. I knew he had been a
sort of pacifist, and that he had German friends and
business connections. I like men to be broad-minded.
I don&#39;t mind a man that sticks to honest
conclusions, if they&#39;re sincere, but when I find they are
coloured by physical or moral cowardice, why, then I&mdash;I&#39;m
through. Albert Chambers is a coward, and he&#39;s
a selfish coward. We&#39;ve had it all out and I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hooray,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;I could have told you
that any time this summer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
&quot;And I&#39;m through with marriage or any idea of
marriage, so there we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t envy you the sweet task of breaking it to
Mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven&#39;t you got any feeling, Peggy? Don&#39;t
you care how hard the things are I&#39;ve been going
through?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t I?&quot; said Peggy. She flung the folds of muslin
wide, and made an impetuous dive for her sister.
&quot;Oh, Ruthie, Ruthie, Ruthie,&quot; she cried, &quot;I&#39;m so
glad, I&#39;m trying not to believe it, for fear it isn&#39;t so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth clung to her wordlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love you, I love you,&quot; Peggy whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tried to do the right thing,&quot; Ruth said. &quot;It&#39;s
been hard to know what was right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You&#39;re</i> all right,&quot; said Peggy, feebly. &quot;Excuse
these tears all down your back, Ruthie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got to be at home for lunch,&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;they&#39;re expecting me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t mind us,&quot; Peggy said, &quot;this is only a
small family reunion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I&#39;d really better go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll write a note to your brother, Elizabeth, when
it&#39;s settled. Mr. Chambers doesn&#39;t even understand
it yet, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have told Buddy unless you had told
me to,&quot; Elizabeth said.</p>

<p class="indent">Ruth smiled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
&quot;I might have known you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; she said,
&quot;your own kind of people have your own sense of
decency, and the others never have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so glad I seem to you like your own kind of
people.&quot; Elizabeth took Ruth Farraday&#39;s out-stretched
hand gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you do, dear, and you always have. On
your own account, I mean.&quot; she added, quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what I meant, too,&quot; said Elizabeth, shyly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was hard to sit through the mid-day meal with
the secret that would change Buddy&#39;s world for him
locked in her breast, still Elizabeth managed it somehow.
He looked very pale and worn, but the three
men kept up a lively discussion of the impending
Presidential campaign and other political matters.
She noticed the respect that both her father and
Buddy paid to Grandfather&#39;s opinions on all these
subjects.</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth wondered how it could be that Buddy
could laugh his hearty laugh, before he knew the
thing that she could have told him or how, when
the conversation turned to the question of bait for a
day&#39;s fishing on the banks that the three men
contemplated, he could discuss worms and fishing
tackle so eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speaking of fish,&quot; Buddy said, &quot;it seems to me
that these are extraordinarily good herrings we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
eating. I don&#39;t suppose there is any difference in
herrings, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you don&#39;t suppose right, then,&quot; Grandfather
said, &quot;there is as much difference in the
herrings that come from Herring River and those you
get over to the westward as there is between some
folks. The meat&#39;s whiter and sweeter in the Herring
River herrings. I used to think it was a great thing to
go after them in the spring. It don&#39;t make no difference
where a herring has been putting in his time in
the other seasons, come spring he makes for the
river bed where he was born. I&#39;ve seen them so
thick on their way up Herring River that they
couldn&#39;t swim straight, but had to kind of flop over
one side to make way for t&#39;other. I used to get five
cents a hundred for &#39;em, and kitch &#39;em as fast as I
could haul &#39;em out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That isn&#39;t true, is it?&quot; asked Elizabeth. &quot;Do
herrings go back to the place where they were born?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and sometimes they swim a great many
hundreds of miles to get there. They seek the
Southern waters in the cold weather, you know, but
they always come back once a year to the stream in
which they were born,&quot; Elizabeth&#39;s father explained
to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The place where their great-grandfathers were
spawned. It&#39;s natural,&quot; Grandfather said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it is natural,&quot; Elizabeth said, soberly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
&quot;You bet it is,&quot; said Buddy.</p>

<p class="indent">They took a drive in the new roadster that afternoon,
and Buddy seemed so happy and so free during
the entire course of the day that Elizabeth was
entirely unprepared to find him, as she found him
some time after supper, flung across the bottom of
the big four-poster bed in the guest room, with his
head buried in his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy,&quot; she said, &quot;Buddy, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m all right, Sis. Run along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought perhaps you wanted to walk with me to
the post office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do, but it isn&#39;t time yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s nearly time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When it&#39;s time, we&#39;ll go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buddy, I wouldn&#39;t feel too bad. Things
mightn&#39;t be so dreadful as you think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They might, and then again they mightn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t give up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve given up everything I can give up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem&mdash;pretty much all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Live or die, sink or swim, survive or perish.
Them&#39;s my slogans. I&#39;ll come through all right. I
<i>am</i> all right. Got to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Buddy,&quot; Elizabeth said, &quot;you <i>will</i> be all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a funny thing, little sister, that you don&#39;t
irritate me more. It seems to me that you used to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
quite an irritating child, and now I scarcely mind
you, no matter how Paul Pryish or Polly Anna-ish you
get.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could irritate you more if I wanted to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m perfectly willing to take that for granted.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Just as they reached the post office they met the
Chambers&#39; car piled with a full luggage equipment.
Albert Chambers sat in lonely state within, looking
neither to right nor left.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t go back to dinner, after all,&quot; Elizabeth
thought, &quot;or at any rate, he didn&#39;t stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Buddy made no comment on this encounter, but
he walked composedly through the crowd overflowing
the little building, his head held high, and all the
colour drained from his white face. He even insisted
on stopping at the drug store and regaling Elizabeth
with her favourite marshmallow and maple nut
sundae, though he refused all refreshment for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One thing that the life over there taught you was
that you&#39;ve got to get through every day somehow,&quot;
he said, thoughtfully. &quot;I wish ice-cream soda didn&#39;t
drip so much. There&#39;s a row of pink rings and
chocolate rings all along this counter. I don&#39;t like
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He thinks everything is perfectly horrid,&quot; Elizabeth
said to herself, &quot;and yet he doesn&#39;t give in.
Oh, I think he&#39;s perfectly splendid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
They made a detour and came out by the Flatiron
field, where the station road divided itself into two
separate byways in the crux of which was a letter
box. Ruth Farraday was in the act of mailing a
letter there. It dropped inside as Elizabeth and
Buddy approached.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was just mailing you a letter,&quot; Ruth said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t I get it out?&quot; Buddy asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; Ruth said, &quot;turn and walk with me home,
and I&#39;ll tell you. Elizabeth knows already. I&#39;ve
broken my engagement. No, don&#39;t say anything.
I&mdash;I just want to tell you, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is so much I <i>might</i> say!&quot; Buddy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The reason I broke it has nothing to do with
anything else&mdash;except that I broke it,&quot; she explained,
incoherently. &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean anything but that.
I shall never marry now, I&#39;m going into reconstruction
work abroad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not&mdash;not right away,&quot; Buddy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As soon as I can make my plans&mdash;but there is
one thing I want you to believe. I&#39;ve written it in
the letter, but I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;ve managed
to make it as clear as I meant to. I&#39;ve broken
my engagement only because Mr. Chambers and I
were not suited to each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;know that,&quot; Buddy said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So this might just as well be good-bye between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you wish it so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;Do you doubt I wish it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; Buddy said, &quot;I know how you feel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then&mdash;then good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right here?&quot; said Buddy. &quot;I thought we were
going to walk home with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m nearly home,&quot; Ruth said. &quot;Say it now,
please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Buddy. He stood looking at
her for a moment, levelly into her eyes. Then he
turned away, wheeling as if he were under orders
to march.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me what you know, Elizabeth,&quot; he said, as
they walked on, and Elizabeth told him of what had
happened at the Farradays that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought things were going to be all fixed,&quot;
she concluded, miserably, &quot;and now they seem to be
in a worse tangle than ever. I don&#39;t see what she&#39;s
sending you away for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; said Buddy. &quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she said it was good-bye between you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right. It&#39;s an ethical question with
her. She split up with him because she couldn&#39;t
stand him, not because she wanted me. It&#39;s like
a gentleman&#39;s agreement, you see. You enter into
a mutual arrangement under the supposition that
the other fellow is as decent as yourself. When
you find he isn&#39;t, that releases you, unless the contract
is actually signed. If he&#39;d been all right, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
would have stuck. She wants me to understand
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you do understand it, and I don&#39;t see why
she has to be so cool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want her to be cool,&quot; said Buddy. &quot;What do
you think I wanted? To go in and spend the
evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that would be better than this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it wouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Buddy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t understand you,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;Perhaps
you are not feeling very well, Buddy. You
looked awfully pale there in the post office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not pale now, am I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o, but you look so kind of queer, and you
act queer, too, Buddy. I understood why you respected
her feelings when she wouldn&#39;t break her
engagement, but now that she has, I don&#39;t see why
you go right on respecting them. I&mdash;I thought you
wanted to marry her yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marry her? Why, I&#39;m going to,&quot; said Buddy.
&quot;That&#39;s the point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When&mdash;when?&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as soon as I can get three weeks&#39; salary in
my jeans.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she said she was going away, and&mdash;and
everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll attend to all that!&quot; said Buddy, happily.
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry, Sister.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="h2"><span class="smcap">Good-bye</span></p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth was making a round of farewell
calls. Her summer on Cape Cod was over.
Her trunk had already been packed and sent
by express to New York, with all the other family
baggage excepting the light motor trunk and bags
that they were to carry in the car.</p>

<p class="indent">Moses and Madget and Mabel surrounded her
when she arrived at the Steppes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You look like a lady in them clothes,&quot; Moses
said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s got gloves on,&quot; Mabel said, &quot;and a pink
hat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Loverly gloves,&quot; said Madget, dreamily. &quot;I
want a pink hat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want flowers on <i>my</i> hat,&quot; said Mabel, critically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How nice your house looks,&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;The kitchen floor is clean, and everything put
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mis&#39; Laury Ann, she&#39;s learning me how to do
housework, and I learn Mabel pretty good. Marmer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
she bought some dishes. See &#39;em there. Mabel and
me, we like to keep &#39;em shined up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the two shelves over the pump an array of
formidably coloured, coarse crockery had made its
appearance. Large pink roses heavily smeared with
gilt were the prevailing decoration. Three pink
coffee cups, with a gilded moustache protector in
each, occupied a place of honour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me and Marmer and Mabel has these,&quot; Moses
informed her proudly. &quot;Madget, she drinks out of
a mug. It&#39;s only a plain white mug, so we don&#39;t
put it where it will show. Ma, she says she had just
as soon we would eat out o&#39; them dishes if we&#39;ll clean
&#39;em up after.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who does the cooking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you I done the cooking once,&quot; Moses said,
&quot;how many times have you got to be said it over to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Moses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Moses, argumentatively, &quot;if you was
old enough to boss me, it would be different, but
you ain&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m bigger than you are, Moses, and you are not
big enough to boss me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Moses, &quot;but I&#39;m big enough to fight
you to see who&#39;s got the most strength. Only girls
can&#39;t fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only morally,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Huh?&quot; said Moses, staring blankly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
&quot;Well, never mind. You take care of your mother
and sister and be a nice, clean boy, and&mdash;and learn
your lessons at school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what&#39;ll I get?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll get to be comfortable and happy by your
own efforts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I ain&#39;t going to do what anybody tells me&mdash;much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell yourself, Moses. Tell yourself to be good,
and then mind yourself. I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&#39;m a girl,&quot; Moses said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t make any difference who you are,
Moses. If you don&#39;t try to learn that lesson about
minding yourself, you won&#39;t get on very well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who says so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Laury Ann says so, for one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she tell you to mind yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&mdash;she showed me how to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does she mind herself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always, that&#39;s what makes her&mdash;so nice and kind.
You see, Moses, you are the man of the family, and the
man of the family has to be responsible for it and have
a good control of it. So you&#39;ve got to have a good
control of yourself.&quot; The word was unfortunate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma&#39;s got a control,&quot; Moses said. &quot;Little Eva.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t mean that kind of control, Moses. I
meant&mdash;well, you just think what I meant. I want
you to promise me that you will watch yourself and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
tell yourself what&#39;s right and wrong, just as if you
were telling it to somebody else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll see about it,&quot; said Moses, &quot;but if I
do it, <i>they</i> got to,&quot; he pointed to his sisters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try it a while for yourself, and then if it works,
teach it to them,&quot; said Elizabeth with sudden inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll teach it to them, anyway,&quot; Moses decided.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here comes Marmer,&quot; Mabel cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just slipped over to Mis&#39; Hawes&#39;,&quot; Mrs. Steppe
explained, apologetically. &quot;I had a matter I wanted
to consult her about. My spine kinder give way
last night, and I thought when she was going into a
trance, she might see if Little Eva had anything to
say about it. It ain&#39;t important enough for her to
go into one special for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Elizabeth stared at the vision in purple velvet&mdash;a
tight-fitting basque of obsolete make gripped the
eighteen-inch waist inexorably, and the skirt, cut
to the prevailing eight inches above the floor, exposed
high white canvas shoes with knotted laces, shoes
that had apparently never been cleaned in the course
of their long and useful existence. Mrs. Steppe had
not prefaced this elaborate toilet by arranging her
hair, and the light strands stood out from her face,
straggling and unkempt as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you,&quot; Elizabeth said, a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
confusedly. &quot;I just came in to say good-bye. I&#39;m
going away to-night, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What train be you taking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not taking any train. We&#39;re motoring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Steppe. &quot;I&#39;m glad you got an
automobile to go in. I&#39;m one of those that likes to
see my friends get on in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&mdash;so do I,&quot; said Elizabeth. &quot;What a pretty
colour that dress is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like to wear silks and velvets,&quot; Mrs. Steppe
said, with the slightest emphasis on the <i>I</i>. &quot;Some
people don&#39;t care nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love silks and velvets myself, and that&#39;s a lovely
quality.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I put my money in anything, I like to put
it in something good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed. I think that&#39;s my brother tooting
his horn for me, so I&#39;ll have to say good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s quite a little car, ain&#39;t it?&quot; Mrs. Steppe
surveyed the new roadster from the vantage point
of the window. &quot;For my taste, I like these limousines,
but anything that will go is better than nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Mrs. Steppe, &quot;take care of
yourself. I hope you&#39;ll find me in better health
next summer than you have this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, Mabel. Good-bye, Madget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Mabel, &quot;come again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;Kiss me again, Madget,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;aren&#39;t
you a little sorry I am going? Oh, be good children,
won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring me a present some time,&quot; said Mabel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you say you will, you will&mdash;I know that,&quot;
said Mabel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leggo,&quot; said their mother, &quot;leggo. That little
automobile out there is waiting for her. Tell Moses
to get off that front seat and come back into the
house. I don&#39;t know where the boy&#39;s manners is. I
ain&#39;t never seen any sign of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Elizabeth, as she drove away with
Buddy, &quot;it doesn&#39;t seem as if anybody with so little
intelligence could be so selfish as that Mis&#39; Steppe is.
It saddens me every time I go there. I know I&#39;ve
had a funny call, but it doesn&#39;t seem funny to me.
It never does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you want to be dropped at Peggy&#39;s, don&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give Peggy my love and tell her to keep us informed
about her sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you&#39;ve kept informed about her ever
since she left.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little additional information at times won&#39;t
do any harm. I don&#39;t want her to spring anything
on me&mdash;like getting out of the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
&quot;She&#39;s getting ready to go abroad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She thinks she&#39;s getting ready to go abroad. I
just want about ten days before the day she thinks
she&#39;s going.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s getting her passport.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want her to,&quot; said Buddy, affectionately, &quot;I
want her to have everything go the way she thinks
she wants it to go, and then at the end I want to
step right in and smash it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like that?&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like that,&quot; said Buddy, happily.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to be able to bear this,&quot;
said Peggy. &quot;I thought it was going to be all right
to say good-bye. Everybody has to at this time
of the year, but&mdash;but that doesn&#39;t make it any easier.
I don&#39;t want to part with you at all. I couldn&#39;t sleep
last night, thinking of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither could I,&quot; said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a whole year till next summer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I figured it out. It will be at least two hundred
and seventy-two days before we are down here together
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will it? We might visit each other in the winter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might, but will we? You know my parents
and I know yours. They always have other plans
for their offspring in the vacations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
&quot;How is your mother?&quot; Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s pretty good. I did Mother an injustice.
She&#39;s a better loser than I thought she&#39;d be. She&#39;s
been awfully decent to Ruth. Elizabeth, do you
know what I found out about Ruth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I found out why she broke her engagement. I
would have broken mine. She found out that he
falsified his income tax report. He bragged about
it to her. He thought it was smart. She wouldn&#39;t
stand for it, that&#39;s all. If he hadn&#39;t given himself
away, she&#39;d be Mrs. Millionaire-slacker-Piggy
Chambers, and half over to Europe by this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like to think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, think of me,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;You
don&#39;t care as much as I care. You are going back
to your Jean and you like her best. There, I said
I would bite my tongue out before I said that to you,
and now I&#39;ve gone and said it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s not care what we say,&quot; Elizabeth said.
&quot;I do love Jean. Grandmother always says it
doesn&#39;t make any difference how many children
a woman has, she always has a different place in her
heart for every one. I guess that&#39;s the way it is with
friends. None of them can occupy the same place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only have one in my place,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;you
are my most intimate friend and I am not yours.
Well, I guess I&#39;ll have to get reconciled to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
&quot;I have two most intimate friends,&quot; said Elizabeth,
&quot;don&#39;t cry, Peggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you&#39;re crying yourself, that&#39;s something.
It&#39;s&mdash;it&#39;s a great deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Elizabeth, &quot;there&#39;s Buddy&#39;s
horn again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;Oh, I won&#39;t say good-bye.
I&mdash;I guess I&#39;ll come over there and see you off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She won&#39;t,&quot; Elizabeth thought, &quot;she&#39;s just saying
that to postpone the evil hour. All right, Peggy,
dear,&quot; she said aloud, &quot;good-bye till&mdash;good-bye!&quot;
and she flung her arms around Peggy&#39;s neck in a
suffocating embrace.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the old valanced rocking chairs before the living-room
windows Grandfather and Grandmother Swift
sat alone in the gathering darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;House seems kinder lonesome to-night, don&#39;t
it, Mother? Hard lines to lose the whole family
all to once. They ought to gone off one by one, so&#39;s
we wouldn&#39;t notice it so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Times come and seasons change,&quot; said Grandmother.
&quot;We have to expect to let &#39;em go. We
are lucky to have them coming, even if we do have
to let them go again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young John&mdash;Buddy she calls him&mdash;is as likely
a young feller as I ever see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And as handsome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
&quot;John&mdash;he&#39;s made a fine job of his business and a
fine job of his life, as far as I can see. He keeps remarkable
young for a man of his way of living, too.
Don&#39;t dissipate none. I expect that&#39;s the secret
of it. He picked himself up a pretty likely wife, too&mdash;good
looking and sweet natured and no nonsense
about her. <i>She</i> looks like her, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s going to be about her mother&#39;s size, I
should say, when she gets her growth. She ain&#39;t
quite so fair, but she&#39;s got the same eyes, and the
same long, light-coloured lashes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But her mouth&#39;s all Swift,&quot; said Grandfather.
&quot;You know that tintype we got of John. Why,
cut her hair off, and put her in a boy&#39;s shirt and necktie
and she&#39;d be the image of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When they stood up there together by the door
just before they started, and he put his arm around
your shoulder, the likeness stood out plain then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s Judidy to-night? Gone out with her
feller?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not to-night. The poor critter felt so bad
when she see that car pulling out of the yard that
she burst out into a fit of crying, and put her apron
over her head and run off. She hasn&#39;t been heard
from since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Judidy was fond of <i>her</i>, and she had cause to be.
I guess she give her almost a complete wedding outfit
out of her own fixings that she brought down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
&quot;It was pretty cunning of her to give away the silk
things she set such a store by. She washed &#39;em all
out herself and run new ribbons in them, and then
went and laid them out on Judidy&#39;s bed, with her eyes
full of tears because she was parting with them.
She found out that Judidy had set her heart on silk
underwear for her wedding outfit, and she thought
it all out that she had ought to give them to her. &#39;I
have about everything I want, Grandma,&#39; she said,
&#39;and I&#39;ve had a summer&#39;s wear out of them.&#39; She
don&#39;t exaggerate nothing much, that she does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s been pretty plucky, the way she took right
hold helping you in the kitchen. She&#39;s helped me,
too. When we was getting in the hay, and Zeckal
was busy all the time she mixed up the hog&#39;s vittles
and fed the hens, and carted big pails of water
around. Faith, Hope, and Charity, they&#39;ve been
squealing considerable to-night, I notice. I guess
they kinder feel the absence of a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember the first night she come, Father?
You was kind o&#39; disappointed in her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So was you, but you didn&#39;t let on nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said that you kinder hoped that John&#39;s girl
was going to be a little more like folks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did I?&quot; he said. &quot;Well, she turned out to be a
good deal more like folks than most people ever gets
to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Grandmother wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m most always able to be
philosophical about everything, but to tell the truth,
I don&#39;t know how I am going to be able to get along
without that child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;&quot; Grandfather took off his spectacles
and wiped them carefully before he transferred his
attention to the process of mopping his forehead&mdash;&quot;well,
I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to get along without
her, either,&quot; he said.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
